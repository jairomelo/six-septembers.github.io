This is the website for the *Six Septembers: Mathematics for the Humanist* reading group, by Patrick Juola and Stephen Ramsay. The [book is available here as a PDF](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/zeabook/55/), but the full text will be on this site (with the authors' approval) for reading group participants to annotate using Hypothesis.
