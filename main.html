  <div class="epigraph">Look at mathematics: it&#8217;s not a science, it&#8217;s a monster slang, it&#8217;s nomadic.<hr />
  <div class="episource">Deleuze and Guattari <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">A Thousand Plateaus</span></div></div>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >This is a book on advanced mathematics intended for humanists.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  We could defend ourselves in the usual way; everyone can benefit from knowing
something about mathematics in the same way that everyone can benefit from knowing
something about Russian literature, or biology, or agronomy. In the current university
climate, with its deep attachment to &#8220;interdisciplinarity&#8221; (however vaguely defined), such
arguments might even seem settled.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  But we have in mind a much more practical situation that now arises with great
regularity. Increasingly, humanist scholars of all stripes are turning their attention toward
materials that represent enormous opportunities for the future of humanistic inquiry. We
are speaking, of course, of the vast array of digital materials that now present
themselves as objects of study: Google Books (rumored to be over twenty <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">million</span>
volumes at the time of this writing); vast stores of GIS data; digitized census records;
image archives of startling breadth; and above all, the World Wide Web itself,
which may well be the most important &#8220;human record&#8221; of the last five hundred
years.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  We have great confidence that the humanities will not only benefit from the digital turn,
but that it will develop its own distinct methodologies for dealing with this sudden
embarrassment of riches. At the same time, the nature of that material has created a world
in which English professors are engaged in data mining, historians are becoming interested
in ever more advanced forms of regression analysis, librarians are learning to program, art
historians are exploring image segmentation, and philosophers are delving into the world of
computational linguistics.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Or rather, some are. The field now known as &#8220;digital humanities&#8221;&#8212;a strikingly
interdisciplinary (and international) group of scholars engaged in such pursuits&#8212;remains a
comparatively small band of devoted investigators, when compared to the larger and older
disciplines from which they come. The reasons for this should be obvious; all of the
techniques mentioned above require that one stray into intellectual territory that was
until recently the exclusive province of the sciences (whether computer, social, or
&#8220;hard&#8221;).
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  The humanist scholar who undertakes to study data mining, advanced statistics, or text
processing algorithms often approaches these subjects with great optimism. After many
years spent studying subjects of comparable complexity in literature, history, or ancient
languages, he or she certainly has reason to believe that whatever knowledge is demanded
will become tractable with the right amount of determination and hard work.
Data mining is complicated, but so is French literary theory. Everyone has to start
somewhere.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  But that attempt often ends badly. A humanist scholar who tries to read an article in, say,
a computer science journal&#8212;or even, for that matter, an introductory text on a highly
technical subject&#8212;will quite often be brought up short the minute things get mathematical
(as they almost inevitably will). There is much that the assiduous student can glean with the
proper amount of effort in such situations, but when the equations appear, old
phobias appear with them. It might as well be Greek. It would be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">easier </span>if it were
Greek.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  We have very particular ideas about what is lacking here. In our experience, the problem
stems from two deficiencies:
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">Humanists without training in the formal notation of <br 
class="newline" />mathematics&#8212;notation  which  in  nearly  every  case  values  concision  over
      explanatory transparency&#8212;cannot make their way through an argument that
      depends on that notation. And there is, in general, no way to &#8220;figure it out&#8221;
      without that training.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1004x2">Humanists often lack the proper set of concepts for dealing with mathematical
      material&#8212;concepts  that  are  independent  of  their  specific  manifestation  in
      equations  and  proofs,  but  without  which  mathematical  arguments  become
      mostly unintelligible.</li></ol>
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  This book does not explain all of the mathematics that anyone is likely to encounter in
the humanities. That would be impossible, to begin with; part of what makes the digital
humanities so exciting is the constant eruption of lateral thinking that allows a scholar to
see some tool or technique, apparently unrelated to the humanities, as a new vector for
study and contemplation. Our purpose, instead, is to impart the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">concepts </span>that we believe
underlie most of the mathematics that you are likely to encounter, and to unfold the
notation in a way that removes that particular barrier completely. This book is, in
other words, a primer&#8212;a book that you can use to develop the skills and habits
of mind that will allow you take on more complicated technical material with
confidence.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >  Some of what we talk about in this book is directly applicable to problems in the
humanities, but that is not our main concern. Much of it is devoted to material that might
never appear in the ordinary course of &#8220;doing&#8221; digital humanities, sociology, game studies,
or computational linguistics. Yet we firmly believe that all of what we discuss here is in the
back of the mind of anyone who does serious technical work in these areas. This book, to
put it plainly, is concerned with the things that the author of a technical article knows,
but isn&#8217;t saying. Like any field, mathematics operates under a regime of shared
assumptions, and it is our purpose to elucidate some of those assumptions for the
newcomer.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  The individual subjects we tackle are (in order): logic and proof, discrete mathematics,
abstract algebra, probability and statistics, calculus, and differential equations. This is not
at all the order in which these subjects are usually taught in school curricula, and indeed, it
is possible to take a course of study that does not include all of them. Our ordering is borne
of our own sense of how best to convey the concepts of mathematics to humanists, and is,
like mathematics itself, strongly cumulative. We have made no attempt to write chapters
that can stand on their own, and would therefore strongly suggest that they be read in
order.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >  Of course, any of these areas could be the subject of a multi-volume series of books. In
fact, all of them are, and we recommend additional reading where appropriate. Our aim
here is to introduce the major concepts and terminology of the areas, not to provide a
detailed exploration of the technical foundations or even necessarily to catalog the major
results in the areas. Instead, we present concepts and vocabulary appropriate to the first few
weeks of&#8212;a September, so to speak&#8212;of a rigorous, university-level course, but (we hope)
with a presentation more focused on understanding and application and less on proof
techniques.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  We assume knowledge of nothing more than basic algebra (along with, perhaps,
elementary geometry and a general sense of the main ideas in trigonometry). We are
aware, of course, that for most of our readers, decades have passed since these
subjects were first unfolded. We provide a bracingly brief refresher course in
algebra in the appendix, though you may find it helpful to turn to it only when
needed.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  This book is written by two humanists. One is a professor of English who found
himself drawn to the digital humanities, and then struggled mightily (for years)
through the very situation we describe above before gaining facility with the subject.
The other is a professor of mathematics and computer science who has spent his
entire career in the company of humanists, struggling to understand their questions
and their methodologies. This collaboration has been sustained at every turn by
certain attitudes which hold in common, and which we have tried to bring to these
pages.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  First, we have nothing but contempt for the phrase &#8220;math for poets&#8221;&#8212;a sobriquet we
consider only slightly less demeaning and derisive than &#8220;logic for girls.&#8221; The
implication that this idea ensconces (often, sadly, in course titles) is one that we reject,
because it implies that the subject can only be understood if certain, largely negative
things are assumed about the student&#8217;s abilities. We assume that our readers are
motivated adults who need explanations, not some radically reframed version of
the subject that makes rude assumptions about &#8220;the way they think.&#8221; We have
tried very hard to explain things as clearly as we can, but we do not shy away
from &#8220;real&#8221; mathematics. Since it is an introductory text, we are aware not only
of roads not taken, but of simplifications that scarcely convey the depths of the
subjects we&#8217;re discussing. But again, we have taken this route in order to lay proper
emphasis on concepts, not to present a watered-down version of a complicated
subject. The &#8220;for&#8221; in our title is as it appears in the phrase, &#8220;We have a gift for
you.&#8221;
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >  We also believe firmly in autodidacticism. Aside from having a very noble tradition in
mathematics (some of the greatest mathematicians have been, properly speaking,
self-educated amateurs), this mode of learning becomes a necessity for those of us long out
school and without opportunity to undertake years of organized study. At the same time, we
believe in community. We aren&#8217;t so bold as to think that we&#8217;ve hit upon the most lucid
explanations possible in every case, and we encourage you to seek out mentors who can
help. We even provide a forum for such discussions on the website that accompanies this
book.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  Finally, we believe in the humanities. Both of us have an enduring fascination with
mathematics, but our passions as scholars remain focused on the ways in which this subject
holds out the possibility of fruitful interaction with the study of the human record. The hope
we have for this book is not that it will create new mathematicians, but that it will
embolden people to see new possibilities for the subjects to which they&#8217;ve devoted
themselves.

<a 
 id="Q1-1-4"></a>
<a 
 id="x1-2000doc"></a>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Having just extolled your virtues as a serious, motivated, autodidact, we nonetheless need
to admit that reading mathematics can be a difficult matter&#8212;even in the context of an
introductory text like this.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  We borrow the title of this section from a similar note to the reader in Silvanus P.
Thompson&#8217;s 1910 book <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Calculus Made Easy</span>&#8212;a widely acknowledged masterpiece of clear
and elegant mathematical exposition that has, in many ways, inspired our own work. We
especially like the subtitle: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Being a Very-Simplest Introduction to Those Beautiful Methods</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">of Reckoning Which Are Generally Called by the Terrifying Names of the Differential</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Calculus and the Integral Calculus. </span>We are not so far from being beginners in this subject
as to have no sense of the terror to which Thompson refers; it visits everyone, sooner or
later.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  You will almost certainly say to yourself at some point: &#8220;Wait. I am lost.&#8221; We
believe firmly that there are several ways out of this pathless wood&#8212;the chief
one being the avoidance of those conditions that get us there in the first place. In
particular:
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2002x1">We  who  are  used  to  reading  books  and  scholarly  articles  in  the  humanities
      seldom get &#8220;stuck&#8221; when reading something. If we miss an idea, we can usually
      recover as the narrative proceeds. Mathematical reading is not like this. The
      subject is by nature cumulative, and some of the apparently trivial things we
      say at the beginnings of chapters have great moment later on. It is therefore
      necessary to check your understanding constantly: &#8220;Did I get that? Do I really
      understand that?&#8221; We really can&#8217;t emphasize this enough.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2004x2">As  a  direct  corollary:  Mathematical  reading  is  very  slow.  It  is  not  at  all
      uncommon  for  a  professional  mathematician  to  spend  weeks  &#8220;reading&#8221;  an
      eight-page  article.  We  doubt  that  anything  in  our  pages  will  require  such
      patience, but we want to caution against too brisk a pace and assure you that
      even the most gifted mathematician is moving at a fraction of the speed with
      which an ordinary reader moves through, say, a novel.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2006x3">&#8220;Mathematics,&#8221;  to  quote  one  of  our  beloved  instructors,  &#8220;is  not  a  spectator
      sport.&#8221; We have no desire to make our subject feel like homework, but there&#8217;s
      no getting around the fact that to understand mathematical ideas, you have to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">do</span>
      mathematics. We therefore humbly suggest that you seek out problems to solve.
      Nothing will elucidate the subject faster than trying to work out how a given
      concept applies to a given problem. We provide some sample exercises on the
      website that accompanies this book, but the best problems are those that occur
      to you as you&#8217;re working in some other area (say, looking at the mechanics of
      a game or trying to understand a social network). Our emphasis, once again,
      is on concepts, but many of these same concepts emerged in the context of
      real-world  problems  to  be  solved.  There&#8217;s  no  substitute  for  re-creating  the
      conditions under which those insights first became manifest.</li></ol>
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  We are teachers, and we suspect that many of our readers are as well. Even if you are not
a teacher, you can easily understand something that every experienced teacher knows very
well: that when it comes to teaching complicated subjects, half the battle is getting students
to recognize themselves as the sort of people who can do it well. We have to get
to &#8220;I got it&#8221; early and often in order to build the confidence that is required to
proceed.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  The temptation, when one becomes lost, is to assume that it is your fault&#8212;that you&#8217;re
just not built for this. We think that many things may have gone wrong in such cases (the
authors&#8217; lack of clarity among them). But we think (and there is research to prove it) that
human beings are built for mathematical thinking in the same way that human beings are
built for speaking and using tools. When the moment comes (and it will), our
advice is to heed the points above and to recognize that people with significantly
fewer intellectual gifts than yourself have successfully mastered this material.
Thompson offers an ancient proverb as the epigraph to his text that is beloved by
scientists, engineers, and mathematicians the world over, and which we think
is a good thing to repeat during the dark night: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">What one fool can do, another</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">can.</span>



  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-30001"></a>Logic and Proof</h2>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >The great twentieth-century British mathematician, G. H. Hardy <br 
class="newline" />(1877&#8211;1947), once wrote, &#8220;I have never done anything &#8216;useful.&#8217; No discovery of mine has
made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the
amenity of the world&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhardy:mathematician">5</a>]</span>. Yet he did allow that one of his discoveries had indeed been
important&#8212;namely, his &#8220;discovery&#8221; of the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa
Ramanujan (1887&#8211;1920). Ramanujan, with almost no training in advanced mathematics,
had managed to derive some of the most important mathematical results of the last five
centuries while working as a clerk at the Account-General&#8217;s office in Madras. He had sent
some of his work to several members of the mathematics faculty at Cambridge, but only
Hardy had recognized Ramanujan as a genius. They would become lifelong friends and
collaborators.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  For Hardy, the beauty of mathematics was to be found in the layered elegance by which
theorems are established from more elementary statements. Ramanujan, by contrast, seems
to have found the tedium of proof too burdensome. &#8220;It was goddess Namagiri, he would tell
his friends, to whom he owed his mathematical gifts. Namagiri would write the
equations on his tongue. Namagiri would bestow mathematical insights in his dreams&#8221;
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xkanigel:man">8</a>]</span>:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Hardy  used  to  visit  him,  as  he  lay  dying  in  hospital  at  Putney.  It
      was  on  one  of  those  visits  that  there  happened  the  incident  of  the
      taxi-cab  number.  Hardy  had  gone  out  to  Putney  by  taxi,  as  usual  his
      chosen method of conveyance. He went into the room where Ramanujan
      was lying. Hardy, always inept about introducing a conversation, said,
      probably without a greeting, and certainly as his first remark: &#8220;I thought
      the  number  of  my  taxi-cab  was  1729.  It  seemed  to  me  rather  a  dull
      number.&#8221; To which Ramanujan replied: &#8220;No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a
      very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum
      of two cubes in two different ways.&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xhardy:mathematician">5</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >For Hardy, the story was undoubtedly meant to stand as a tribute to his friend. For surely,
only someone with a very special relationship with numbers could possibly make such an
observation spontaneously. But for all that, one can almost imagine Hardy&#8217;s thoughts on the
ride home. Is it true? And is it, in fact, interesting?
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  We can settle the first question with a <a 
 id="dx1-3001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">proof</span>&#8212;a demonstration that the statement must be
true (or that it must be false). To do this, we would have to show that 1729 is in fact the sum
of two cubes, that there are exactly two such cubes that sum to 1729, and that no smaller
number can be created this way. The second question is undoubtedly a more subjective
one, though we might discover that the proof itself reveals something else about
mathematics, or that the result can be used in other, perhaps more &#8220;interesting&#8221;
demonstrations.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  We have, then, a <a 
 id="dx1-3002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">conjecture</span>: 1729 is the smallest number expressible as the
sum of two cubes in two different ways. Having proved it, it would become a
<a 
 id="dx1-3003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">theorem</span>. If that theorem could in turn be used to establish further theorems, it
would become a <a 
 id="dx1-3004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">lemma</span>. The study of those methods and processes by which
arguments are made, theorems established, and lemmas formed is called <a 
 id="dx1-3005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">mathematical</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">logic</span>.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  The idea of proving ever-more-elaborate statements using the results of earlier proofs is
familiar to most people from secondary-school geometry. Euclidean geometry, in
fact, provides an excellent introduction not only to logic, but to the place of logic
within mathematics. Students who enjoy the subject will remark on its beauty&#8212;on
the way that things &#8220;fit together.&#8221; Yet others are quick to point out that there is
something fundamentally wrong with a system that has to define basic things
like the notion of a point as (to quote Euclid) &#8220;that which has no part&#8221; and a line
as a &#8220;breadthless length.&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xeuclid:elements">4</a>]</span> Even the most enthusiastic student will at some
point ask why it is necessary to prove so many things that are obviously true at a
glance.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  Such questions hint at problems and conundrums that are among the oldest questions in
philosophy. At stake is not merely the virtues and limitations of this or that system, but (one
suspects) the virtues and limitations of our ability to reason about systems in
general. Behind the many methodologies (or &#8220;logics&#8221;) that have been proposed is a
set of basic questions about methodology itself, and about the nature of those
epistemological tools that we have traditionally employed to establish truth and reject
falsehood in matters ranging from the existence of triangles to the proper form of
government.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  Since it is the purpose of this book to present mathematics to humanists, we will focus
here on the tools themselves. Our intention, however, is not to put these larger questions
into abeyance, but rather to draw them forth more forcefully by showing how these systems
actually work and what it is like to work with them. Toward the end, we revisit some of the
major philosophical insights concerning logic and proof for which twentieth-century
mathematics may be most well remembered.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-40001.1"></a>Formal Logic</h3>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Logic usually traffics in the truth and falsehood of statements. To say this is already to
restrict our view, since not all statements are susceptible to such easy classification. Some
statements appear to have nothing at all to do with truth and falsehood (&#8220;Look out for that
tree!&#8221;); others might have something to do with truth and falsehood, but are not themselves
true or false (&#8220;Was that tree there last week?&#8221;).
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  In technical terms, a statement that can be true or false is said to be a <a 
 id="dx1-4001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">proposition </span>(or to
have <a 
 id="dx1-4002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">propositional content</span>). This puts us immediately in more broadly philosophical
territory, since some would like to declare a <a 
 id="dx1-4003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">law of the excluded middle </span>and say that
mathematics is exclusively concerned with statements that are either true or false. This
might seem an undue restriction; surely a system constrained in this way is already
barred from the investigation of more nuanced problems. Yet propositions hold out
a possibility that logicians have been unable to resist&#8212;namely, the idea that a
statement might be &#8220;analytically&#8221; true or true by virtue of its structure. For this
reason, one might view <a 
 id="dx1-4004"></a>logic as the study of the structure of arguments. The goal is
not so much to prove this or that, but rather to say that statements of a certain
form&#8212;independent even of their content&#8212;must always serve to support a given
argument.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-50001.1.1"></a>Deduction and Induction</h4>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Though there are many logical systems, mathematical logicians traditionally distinguish
between the two broad classes familiar to us from philosophy and science: deductive and

premises <a

general conclusions. Every fish I&#8217;ve seen lives in the water, so therefore I conclude that all
fish live in water.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  This common distinction hints at the idea of analytical truth. Arguments based on
deductive reasoning are guaranteed to be correct (provided we follow certain rules), while
those based on inductive reasoning are not. So even if all the swans I have ever seen are
white, the statement &#8220;All swans are white&#8221; can be demonstrated as false the minute
an informed reader demonstrates the existence of black ones. Some logicians
have suggested that this guarantee is a better criterion for defining the difference
between deductive and inductive logic. It is, after all, possible to reason to some
kinds of general statements from specific examples. Seeing a goldfish living in a
fishbowl, I can say with certainty that the statement &#8220;all fish live in the ocean&#8221;
cannot be true, but under the revised criterion, this would be considered a deductive
argument.

careful and precise definition of the terms. Defining things doesn&#8217;t itself guarantee

shave himself (because he shaves all the men who aren&#8217;t self-shavers), and therefore he
must be a self-shaver. Conversely, if he is a self-shaver, then (since he shaves only
men who aren&#8217;t self-shavers), he must not shave himself, and therefore is not a
self-shaver.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >  The paradox, then, is that if the sentence &#8220;The barber is a self-shaver&#8221; is true,
then the same sentence must be false. If the sentence is false, then it has to be
true. But it can&#8217;t be both true and false (the law of the excluded middle again),
and so it therefore can&#8217;t be either true or false without contradicting itself. It is a
paradox.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >  In practical terms, a paradox means that there is something wrong with your assumptions
and definitions. In the twenty-first century, this paradox loses something of its punch when
we note that female barbers exist. If you assume (implicitly) that the barber is a man, the
paradox is genuine. However, if the barber is a woman, then the situation can be
resolved by noting that the problem specifically states that she shaves &#8220;all and
only the men&#8221;&#8212;i.e. the problem is explicit about the fact that her client list is
exclusively male. Naturally, then, she doesn&#8217;t shave herself, but there is no paradox. She
simply doesn&#8217;t shave herself&#8212;if she is shaved at all, someone else must do it for
her.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >  Paradoxes have been hugely influential in mathematics precisely because they are so
good at rooting out hidden assumptions and problems with definitions. Obviously, any
logical scheme that permits the inference of paradoxes is to be avoided. As we&#8217;ll see later,
one of the most earth-shattering insights in modern mathematics relies on the elucidation of
a paradox.

and influential forms of logic. During the period that stretches from the high middle ages to the

argument we&#8217;ve been examining up until now: an argument based on two premises and a
conclusion. The ancients discerned four basic forms that the statements of a syllogism
could take:

<!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >  Enumerating all of the valid syllogisms was considered a good way of learning which
ones were and were not &#8220;valid&#8221; arguments within this framework. A more powerful
property emerged, however, when the valid syllogisms were rewritten as prescriptive
rules about how to reason. For example, we can restructure the Barbara syllogism
as:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >If you have a pair of premises &#8220;All A are B&#8221; and &#8220;All B are C,&#8221; you may

<!--l. 219--><p class="noindent" >This is an example of an <a 
 id="dx1-11011"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">inference rule</span>. Such a rule can be used in one of two ways. First,
it can be used, once again, as a truth-making machine. Given a pair of statements in the
appropriate form, the &#8220;machine&#8221; can infer the appropriate conclusion. It can also be used,
in reverse, as a system for checking the truth of a statement or the validity of an argument.
If a statement is offered as a conclusion, we could check to see whether the pair of premises
corresponds to a valid syllogistic structure. This checking can be done without detailed
knowledge of the propositions in question; in fact, if the statements are offered in a
sufficiently stereotypical form, it could be done by a computer with nothing more than text
matching.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >  While the influence of syllogistic logic is everywhere evident in the systems which came
to replace it, it has now more-or-less disappeared as a subject of intensive inquiry in
philosophy and mathematics. That is due, at least in part, to evolving notions of what logic
itself is about. Earlier, we described logic as a system for discerning the truth
or falsehood of statements. While that is true, we can also think of logic as an
attempt to provide rigorously defined meanings and interpretations for particular
words. Syllogistic logic provides quite precise descriptions for words like &#8220;all,&#8221;
&#8220;some,&#8221; and &#8220;none.&#8221; It falters, however, even with the introduction of a word like

<!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >  In general, the problem with syllogistic logic is not so much a matter of logical validity,
but of expressive power. The revolution in logic that began in the nineteenth-century with
the work of people like George Boole (1815&#8211;1864) and Augustus de Morgan
(1806&#8211;1871) was occasioned not only by the quest for better &#8220;truth machines,&#8221; but by
attempts to understand language and its relation to thought and meaning. As we
shall see, it also led to revolutionary ideas about the foundations of mathematics
itself.

the apparent simplicity of such phrases, the precise logic of such connectives can be more
difficult to grasp. Our intuitive understanding is that the statement &#8220;if the Yankees win two

statement is true and the Yankees win two more games, they will indeed make the
playoffs. Second, if the Yankees win two more games, but don&#8217;t make the playoffs,
then the statement was false. But what about the case where the Yankees don&#8217;t
win? If the Yankees don&#8217;t win two more games, but slip into the playoffs anyway,
was the original statement false? How about if the Yankees don&#8217;t win any more
games, and don&#8217;t make the playoffs? Was the speaker lying? Intuition suggests, and
propositional logic agrees, that an &#8220;if-then&#8221; statement is true, even when the first part is
false.

Some propositions with this connective have a double implication because they
combine two separate implications. For example, &#8220;The Yankees will make the
playoffs if and only if they win two more games&#8221; suggests two things. In this
case, one is saying not only that &#8220;if the Yankees win two, they will make the

<!--l. 305--><p class="indent" >  Using these basic semantic primitives, it becomes possible to construct more
complicated propositions. &#8220;All of the seven dwarfs have a beard except for Dopey,&#8221; for
example, can be built with six conjunctions and one negation:
      <ul class="itemize1">

<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" >It is also possible to devise other connectives in terms of the ideas expressed above. Some

These two concepts can be understood as the difference implicit in the following
questions:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Would you like milk or sugar in your coffee?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Would you like beef or chicken at the banquet?</li></ul>
<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >It is acceptable and even expected that one might answer the first question with &#8220;Both,
please,&#8221; but not the second. In the first case, the answer &#8220;yes&#8221; includes the possibility
of both. Similarly, a statement with an inclusive or is true &#8220;if and only if&#8221; the
first disjunct is true, the second disjunct is true, or both are. This is the standard
semantics of disjunction discussed above (no one would expect to be served two
main courses). Similarly, a proposition with an exclusive or is true if and only
if one or the other disjunct is true, but not both. The statement &#8220;Timothy is a
chinchilla or Sasha is a cat&#8221; might therefore be either true or false, depending
upon whether &#8220;or&#8221; is interpreted as inclusive or exclusive&#8212;again, we see the
focus in mathematical expression on clear definitions to avoid confusion and
ambiguity.
<!--l. 327--><p class="indent" >  The aim, though, is not merely clarity but generality. As with syllogistic logic, we&#8217;d like

however, arises because of the complexities of natural language. Earlier, we had negated
phrases like &#8220;Percy is a cat&#8221; with &#8220;It is not the case that Percy is a cat.&#8221; The reason for such

<!--l. 473--><p class="indent" >  Recall our earlier discussion of validity. An argument is valid if and only if it is not
possible (in any possible world) for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the
same time. This truth table lists all the possible states of the world&#8212;S is either
true or false, and so is T (independently). We can thus confirm by inspecting the
table above that both premises are true in only one of the four possible worlds
(the one marked out in capital letters). In this same line, the conclusion is also
shown be true. Therefore, in any possible world where the premises are true,
so is the conclusion. The argument is demonstrated, using a rote method, to be
valid.
<!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >  While truth tables can be used to test any argument in propositional logic, they can
become too cumbersome in some cases. A truth table that involves only a single variable
can be represented with only two lines (as in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-130021">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: table:notsemantics --></a> or table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-140033">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:equivexample --></a>). An only slightly more
complex table involving two variables (as above) needs four lines to cover the four
possible cases. However, a wff with only three prepositional variables would need,
not four or six, but eight lines (four for the case where the third variable was
true, four for the case where it was false), and in general, adding another variable
will double the number of rows in the table. An argument that began with &#8220;One
of the seven dwarfs (Grumpy or Sneezy or Sleepy or Doc, etc.) doesn&#8217;t have a
beard&#8221; would take more than a hundred lines. An argument that began &#8220;one of the
191 UN member states&#x2026;&#8221; would take more lines than there are protons in the
universe.

<!--l. 584--><p class="noindent" >We could, of course, provide detailed justifications for why these are valid (perhaps
using truth tables). In the interest of brevity, we&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise for
the reader. But we can&#8217;t pass so quickly through this list without noting that the
development of these inference rules stands among the more notable achievements
of mathematical logic in the last two hundred years or so. They are also very
commonly used in mathematical arguments. We won&#8217;t belabor the point, but it might
be useful to meditate on these insights in greater detail once we&#8217;ve finished our
overview.
<!--l. 586--><p class="indent" >  It is possible to define inference rules in terms of other inference rules, and indeed, to
prove the validity of any particular inference rule using one or more of the others.
Mathematicians have even managed to demonstrate that only one inference rule is
actually necessary (modus ponens), and that all others can be derived from it. As
elegant as this insight may be, such a restricted rule set can make arguments and
proofs extremely confusing. Even so, mathematicians sometimes differ over the
number of inference rules they will accept in a specific formulation of propositional
logic.
<!--l. 588--><p class="indent" >  Propositional logic has proven itself to be a powerful tool for thinking about separate
propositions. Unfortunately, it suffers from the same sort of limitations that syllogistic logic
does&#8212;there are obviously valid arguments that cannot be proven in propositional logic
(including, amazingly, many of the syllogisms we studied earlier). In particular,
propositional logic lacks the machinery necessary to peer inside a simple statement, such as
a generalization, and see how the generalization applies in specific instances. Where
syllogistic logic could not deal with &#8220;or,&#8221; propositional logic cannot deal with &#8220;all&#8221; or
&#8220;some.&#8221;
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.3</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 593--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Predicate logic</span><a 
 id="dx1-15001"></a> is a hugely influential system designed to remedy this. It introduces the
notion of an expression (called a <a 
 id="dx1-15002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">predicate</span>) that expresses an incomplete concept (e.g. &#8220;&#x2026;is
a cat&#8221; or &#8220;&#x2026;is blue&#8221;). It then puts forth a semantics for reasoning about concepts that may
apply to some part of the world of discourse but not others. (The term &#8220;predicate&#8221; is
borrowed from grammar, where it refers to the part of the sentence that isn&#8217;t the
subject.)
<!--l. 595--><p class="indent" >  The logics we&#8217;ve dealt with so far make it easy to deal with complete statements like
&#8220;Bart Simpson is left handed&#8221; (which happens to be true). Predicate logic introduces
incomplete statements in order to allow us to work with statements like &#8220;<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>is left-handed&#8221;
where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>is an unspecified variable. The advantages of this become clearer when we try to
discuss a particular set of logical statements in which the properties of a set of particular
values is in question.
<!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >  Suppose, for example, that we want to discuss&#8212;in an extremely formal and stilted
way&#8212;the handedness of the members of The Beatles. We could begin by assigning each
member of the band to a <a 
 id="dx1-15003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">constant </span>(that is, to a symbol, the value of which we do not intend
to change). Thus <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,b,c </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">d </span>become John, Paul, George and Ringo, respectively. We&#8217;ll
also replace the partial statement &#8220;&#x2026;is left-handed&#8221; with a <a 
 id="dx1-15004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">predicate variable</span>:
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">L</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">)</span>. In this latter formation, we refer to <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>as the <a 
 id="dx1-15005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">argument </span>or <a 
 id="dx1-15006"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">parameter </span>of
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">L</span>.
<!--l. 599--><p class="indent" >  Armed with this system, we can now assert that <span

a more concise way of saying that &#8220;<span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">d </span>(Ringo) is
left-handed.&#8221; Similarly, we can assert <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">c</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) </span>(i.e. that neither John nor
George is left-handed). And, of course, the connectives have their usual semantics:
<span

<!--l. 764--><p class="noindent" >Earlier, in our discussion of paradoxes, we noted that a paradox usually indicates that
something is deeply wrong&#8212;not a misapplied method or a mistake, but a flaw in the
assumptions and definitions upon which the entire formulation rests. In the late-nineteenth
and early-twentieth centuries, it became obvious to practicing mathematicians that many of
the intuitive concepts underlying mathematical practice were actually paradoxical. One
example of this is the <a 
 id="dx1-19001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Grelling-Nelson paradox</span>, which addresses the relationship between
the act of naming and the world.
<!--l. 766--><p class="indent" >  Kurt Grelling (1886&#8211;1942) and Leonard Nelson (1882&#8211;1927) observed that, at least in
some instances, the very act of defining things can create a paradox&#8212;which is problematic,
given that definitions represent one of the major ways human beings divide up the world.
They defined a new pair of words, &#8220;autological&#8221; and &#8220;heterological,&#8221; as descriptions of
adjectives. An &#8220;autological&#8221; adjective is one that describes itself. For example,
the word &#8220;terse&#8221; is itself terse, the word &#8220;pentasyllabic&#8221; is itself pentasyllabic,
&#8220;unhyphenated&#8221; is unhyphenated, and &#8220;English&#8221; is itself English. An adjective
is &#8220;heterological&#8221; if and only if it is not autological; for example &#8220;Japanese,&#8221;
&#8220;monosyllabic,&#8221; and &#8220;flammable&#8221; are not autological and therefore are heterological.
Because this definition is an explicit division, every adjective is either autological or
heterological.
<!--l. 768--><p class="indent" >  But what of the word &#8220;heterological&#8221; itself? If it is itself autological, then it must
describe itself and therefore be heterological. Conversely, if it is heterological, then it does
describe itself and is therefore autological. Either way, it must (impossibly) both be and not
be heterological, yielding the paradox.
<!--l. 770--><p class="indent" >  This is obviously a close relative of the Barber paradox discussed earlier. As with the
Barber paradox, the solution is to reject an assumption. But in this case, the assumption that
would need to be rejected is the assumption that one can simply make up definitions and
divide the world. The very act of defining would seem to introduce paradoxes into our
reasoning.

  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 775--><p class="noindent" >Similar paradoxes were being discovered relating to many aspects of (then-current)
mathematics. In particular, the theory of &#8220;sets&#8221; at that time relied on an informal
understanding that a <a 
 id="dx1-20001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">set </span>was just a collection of objects, and that for any property one might
care to define, one implicitly defined the set of all objects with that property. Since we
know about the idea of &#8220;red,&#8221; we also know about the set of things that are red. Since we
know about even numbers, we know about the set of numbers that are even. This notion
was formalized by many turn-of-the-twentieth-century mathematicians, most notably
Gottlob Frege (1848&#8211;1925).
<!--l. 777--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately, this naive notion of a set generates almost exactly the same paradox.
Known as <a 
 id="dx1-20002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Russell&#8217;s paradox </span>(after the discoverer, Bertrand Russell, 1872&#8211;1970), it
involves defining, not a new word, but a new property: that of &#8220;not being a member of
itself.&#8221; For example, the set of all things that are not an elephant would include the authors,
the reader, the Eiffel tower&#x2026;and of course that set itself. Similarly the set of all sets (the set
of all things that are sets) is a set, and the set of all mathematical concepts is a
mathematical concept. On the other hand, the set of all weekdays isn&#8217;t itself a
weekday.
<!--l. 779--><p class="indent" >  But what happens when we ask about the set of all sets that are not members of itself? Is
this set a member of itself?
<!--l. 781--><p class="indent" >  The result is a paradox. If the set is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself. If
it is not a member of itself, then it must be a member of itself. As with the earlier
paradoxes, it indicated to the mathematicians at the time that there was something
fundamentally wrong with our naive formulation of set theory.
<!--l. 783--><p class="indent" >  But if set theory does not follow our intuitions, what else is likely to break? What about
the mathematical results that depend upon the ideas and concepts of set theory? How far
does the rot spread? If paradox is a sign that we don&#8217;t understand what we&#8217;re doing, then a
paradox at the heart of mathematics is a problem. For mathematics to progress as a
discipline, it needed to be paradox-free. The solution, it seemed, was to define
as much of mathematics as possible in terms of a few simple and fundamental
principles that could be proven valid and free from paradox. Proofs could then be
put on a sound theoretical basis by justifying them in terms of this minimal and
rigorous set of assumptions whose truth was beyond realistic question. Mathematics
would thus be &#8220;axiomatized&#8221; and formally validated using specific, valid, logic
schemes.

<!--l. 812--><p class="indent" >  Any system that is not complete can (presumably) be enhanced by the addition of new
inference rules, and similarly, an unsound system can have its ruleset trimmed to eliminate
fallacious conclusions. Combine that with a system sufficiently expressive as to allow one
to express any concept, and one presumably has a perfect logical system. The key question,
then&#8212;and at the turn of the last century, a question of world-wide interest&#8212;is whether
such a system is possible. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in
1900, the great German mathematician David Hilbert (1862&#8211;1943) famously
proposed it as one of twenty-three open, unsolved problems for twentieth-century
mathematics.
<!--l. 815--><p class="indent" >  Thirty-one years later, the mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906&#8211;1978) gave an
answer that pointed to a deep fundamental truth about the nature of mathematics. It
remains one of the most startling results ever proposed by a mathematician, and has
been the source of much (occasionally facile) musing among philosophers ever
since.
<!--l. 817--><p class="indent" >  The answer to that key question, you see, was &#8220;No.&#8221;

 id="x1-220001.3.3"></a>The Greatest Hits of Kurt Gödel</h4>
<!--l. 821--><p class="noindent" >To understand the full significance of Gödel&#8217;s theorems, we have to go back to Russell.
Russell, motivated in part by his own paradox, undertook to write a colossal work that
would set mathematics on a firm foundation once and for all. The machinery he employed
was cumbersome and hard to understand, the notation verged on the inscrutable,
and the amount of detail was fearsome. It was also slow going; one particularly
memorable line stated, &#8220;From this proposition it will follow, when arithmetical addition
has been defined, that 1+1=2&#8221;&#8212;a conclusion offered on page 360. Yet for all
that, the work seemed entirely sound. It began by formally defining set theory in
terms of predicate logic. By the end of the third volume, he and his co-author
Alfred North Whitehead (1861&#8211;1947) had laid down apparently paradox-free
foundations, not only for set theory and logic, but for arithmetic, algebra, and the
basics of analysis and calculus. They called it, in an extraordinary moment of
hubris, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia Mathematica </span>after Isaac Newton&#8217;s rather famous work of that
name.
<!--l. 823--><p class="indent" >  But the question remained: were there unseen paradoxes and contradictions in the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia? </span>In particular, were there any statements in the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia </span>that could be
proven to be both true and false using the mechanisms of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia </span>itself? Were
there any mathematical statements that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">couldn&#8217;t </span>be proven to be either true or
false?
<!--l. 825--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-230001.3.3"></a>Gödel&#8217;s Findings</h5>
<!--l. 827--><p class="noindent" >Gödel was able to address this question directly in a way that shattered the entire program
in a series of three very famous and influential statements.
<!--l. 830--><p class="indent" >  Gödel&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Completeness Theorem</span><a 
 id="dx1-23001"></a> showed that <a 
 id="dx1-23002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">first-order predicate logic </span>was complete
(it had long been known to be sound). Unfortunately, first-order predicate logic itself was
not expressive enough to support the whole of mathematics, and in fact, Gödel&#8217;s proof of
his Completeness Theorem couldn&#8217;t be expressed in first-order predicate logic. He needed
to use something stronger.
<!--l. 832--><p class="indent" >  Gödel&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">First Incompleteness Theorem</span><a 
 id="dx1-23003"></a> showed that any formal system of logic
powerful enough to support mathematics&#8212;or arithmetic, for that matter&#8212;had to be either
incomplete or unsound, and specifically inconsistent. He was able to construct a single
statement and show that if that statement was provable, so was its opposite. Therefore,
either both statements were provable (meaning the system was unsound and inconsistent)
or neither were (and the system was incomplete).
<!--l. 834--><p class="indent" >  Gödel&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Second Incompleteness Theorem</span><a 
 id="dx1-23004"></a> showed that it is not possible for a consistent
system powerful enough for arithmetic to prove its own consistency, or alternatively, that
any system capable of proving its own consistency is inconsistent (making the proof
wrong).
<!--l. 836--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-240001.3.3"></a>What Gödel Really Found</h5>
<!--l. 838--><p class="noindent" >Obviously, one can&#8217;t summarize in a few paragraphs or pages all the implications of some
of the most profound results in the history of mathematical logic. But some discussion
is needed, if for no other reason than to cut through some of the philosophical
misunderstandings that have grown up around these theorems.
<!--l. 844--><p class="indent" >  The Completeness Theorem is actually fairly straightforward. Essentially, Gödel
was able to show that first-order logic did really reflect the inherent idea of the
possible-world semantics defined earlier, and that if one formalizes the idea of
&#8220;possible worlds&#8221; strictly in terms of constants and (first-order) predicates, any
statement true in all possible worlds can be proven using the machinery of first-order
logic.
<!--l. 852--><p class="indent" >  The First Incompleteness Theorem however, shows that if we permit second-order and
higher predicates, it is possible to generate paradoxes within the system. The paradox that
Gödel was able to generate is a variation on a very old paradox called the <a 
 id="dx1-24001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Liar</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Paradox</span><a 
 id="dx1-24002"></a>.
<!--l. 857--><p class="indent" >  The Liar Paradox is attributed to (the possibly mythical) Epimenides of Crete (6th c.
B.C.E), who supposedly stated that &#8220;All Cretans are liars.&#8221; Of course, if this statement were
true, then Epimenides himself would have to be a liar, and thus this statement would be a
lie, which means that the statement can&#8217;t be true. There are a few linguistic holes in this
argument, but they can be patched by restating the paradoxical sentence in this
form:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">This sentence is false.</li></ul>
<!--l. 863--><p class="noindent" >If the sentence is true, then of course, it must be false. On the other hand, if the sentence is
false, then it must be the case that the sentence is not false, i.e., true. Either way, the
assumption that the sentence is true or false yields a contradiction, so the sentence is
paradoxical.
<!--l. 865--><p class="indent" >  Gödel was able to construct a similar proposition that stated:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">This sentence is not provable (in this logical system)</li></ul>
<!--l. 871--><p class="noindent" >Obviously, if the sentence can be proved, then it must be true. But if it is true, then it can&#8217;t
be proved. So if the statement both can and cannot be proved, we have our paradox.
Similarly, if the sentence can&#8217;t be proved, then it is true but unprovable&#8212;but in this case we
have an unprovable truth.
<!--l. 873--><p class="indent" >  The brilliance of his proof lies not merely in identifying this as a potential paradox, but
by finding a way to frame this sentence purely in terms of arithmetic properties. His
constructed sentence is really just a huge formula that is either true or false, but that
never actually says anything about &#8220;this sentence&#8221; or &#8220;provable.&#8221; It&#8217;s therefore
possible to construct such a sentence in any logical system powerful enough to
express simple arithmetic ideas like numbers, addition, multiplication, and so
forth.
<!--l. 875--><p class="indent" >  The implications of this are profound. In essence, any system of logic one proposes must
fall into one of three categories. It may be too weak and inexpressive to be able to handle
primary school mathematics (which makes it useless for the logicization program defined
above). It may be unsound, in which case we cannot rely on the proofs. Or it may simply
be incomplete, in which case it is still a usable system, but there are truths in
mathematics that are inaccessible to it. The Second Incompleteness Theorem takes
this further, and shows that any system that can prove its own consistency must
be asserting an incorrect proof, and therefore must fall into the second category
above.
<!--l. 877--><p class="indent" >  This finding, as one might expect, dashed the hopes of many mathematicians
who had expected to find a perfect logical system. Instead, they found that the
best they could make was a conservatively imperfect logical system, one that
could find and validate some truths, but not all of them. Later researchers were
even able to find specific examples of statements that could not be proven true or
false within the framework of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia. </span>On the other hand, the very fact
that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principia </span>is incomplete offers a certain odd assurance. If it were, in fact,
unsound, it would be possible to prove anything at all. So the fact that there are a
few unprovable statements lends a sort of contrastive credence to what we <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">can</span>
prove.
<!--l. 879--><p class="indent" >  These results were hugely influential within the mathematics community, as
one might expect. Gödel himself is often considered to be one of the greatest
mathematicians of the twentieth century (if not of all time). But precisely because of the
revolutionary nature of these findings, his theorems have been enlisted (at times, by
otherwise reputable thinkers) in the project of making broad claims about the
limitations of science, language, computers, and the human mind. Much of this
is fatuous in large part because Gödel&#8217;s theorems have mostly narrow practical
implications and are concerned exclusively with the limitations of mathematical
logic.
<!--l. 881--><p class="indent" >  But even if the implications of Gödel&#8217;s theorem were, within a broad philosophical
perspective, somewhat narrow, the larger cultural implications remain. Hilbert had
announced his &#8220;unsolved problems&#8221; with all the faith and high-minded exuberance of the
nineteenth century:

<!--l. 887--><p class="noindent" >Within a few decades, the centuries-old humanistic program that had begun with the
Enlightenment (itself an era of profound mathematical insight and progress) would give
way to a far more skeptical vision of human possibility. If Newton&#8217;s calculus had
metaphorically typified the Age of Reason, so Gödel&#8217;s theorem would come to
represent the problematic aspirations of the Atomic Age. It wasn&#8217;t that logic had its
limitations (not even the most naive medieval scholastic had doubted that). It was
that for the mightiest of all reasoning systems&#8212;mathematics&#8212;it could never be
otherwise.



  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">2</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-250002"></a>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdös (1913&#8211;1996) spent most of his adult life
traveling from one university to another, working on mathematical problems with friends
and colleagues, and living out of a suitcase that contained nearly all of his worldly
possessions. One of mathematics&#8217;s most legendary eccentrics (and that is saying
something), Erdös has the distinction of being the most prolific mathematician in
history&#8212;the author of over fifteen-hundred papers in areas that range over most of the
subjects in this book.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  As a tribute to Erdös, the custom emerged of assigning &#8220;Erdös numbers&#8221; to research
mathematicians. A mathematician who co-authored a paper directly with Erdös (an honor
held by over five hundred people) is assigned an Erdös number of 1. People who have
collaborated with a member of this group (but not with Erdös himself) have an Erdös
number of 2. If you collaborated with someone who collaborated with someone who has a
1, you&#8217;re a 3 (and so on).
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Having a low Erdös number makes for good bragging rights, and some have suggested that
such proximity to the well known may serve as a reasonable indicator of importance within a
given field.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main10.html#fn1x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-25001f1"></a>
What is most fascinating, however, is the fact that the average Erdös number is less than 5.
This suggests that the network formed by the group who have Erdös numbers exhibits what
is sometimes called the &#8220;small world&#8221; phenomenon. The network itself is quite large, and
most of the people in the network are not neighbors. Yet it only takes a few hops to get
from one node to another. The game known as &#8220;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&#8221;&#8212;a variant of
the Erdös-number concept in which one tries to form connections between actors who
have appeared in a movie with Kevin Bacon&#8212;also demonstrates the concept.
As with Erdös numbers, the strange thing is how easy it is to find a connection;
even moderately knowledgable movie buffs can &#8220;win&#8221; the game with relative
ease.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Speaking of small worlds: It was one of Erdös&#8217;s countrymen, the Hungarian
fiction writer Frigyes Karinthy (1887&#8211;1938), who appears to have been the
first to suggest that everyone in the entire world is connected by &#8220;six degrees
of separation.&#8221; He put this idea forth in a 1929 short story entitled &#8220;Chains,&#8221; in
which people at a party play a game that is remarkably like Six Degrees of Kevin

Bacon.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main11.html#fn2x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-25002f2"></a>
Frigyes&#8217;s story is apropos in more ways than one. The period between the wars
witnessed a marked popular interest in optimization, statistics, and demographics
(Taylorism is at its zenith and the term &#8220;robot&#8221; is coined during this period). There
was also a widespread sense, evident both in art and in public discourse, that the
world was getting smaller. Frigyes&#8217;s game managed to encapsulate both spirits
of the age, and perhaps to anticipate a similar concern with such matters in our
own day. The book in which the story appears is fittingly entitled, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Everything is</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Different.</span>
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  In this chapter, we continue a tradition in mathematics of grouping together a broad set
of loosely related subjects under the general title &#8220;discrete mathematics.&#8221; According to the
usual line of reasoning, discrete mathematics is &#8220;discrete&#8221; because it deals with
structures that are separate, distinct, and enumerable (like the whole numbers, the
objects in a set, or the nodes on a network). This is as opposed to continuous
mathematics, which traffics in things that are, for lack of a better term, &#8220;smooth&#8221; and
&#8220;gapless&#8221; (like the real numbers, the path of a rocket, or the curve of a butterfly&#8217;s
wing).
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  This is a useful division, as far as it goes&#8212;a way to separate the (only apparently)
disparate realms of, say, set theory and calculus&#8212;but it may be more useful (and in the end,
no less rigorous) to think of discrete mathematics as a group of topics that have the same
feel to them. Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics most requisite for
understanding the deep mysteries of computation, including such rarefied matters as
microchip architecture, data structures, algorithms, networks, and cryptography. Yet it is
also the world&#8217;s leading source of games and puzzles (and therefore, an obligatory subject
for students of games and game mechanics). Problems in discrete mathematics often come
down to gaining some insight into the nature of a system. And when you have that
insight, it can feel like you just figured out a trick or discovered a secret. People
work out their Erdös numbers and determine how close an actress is to Kevin
Bacon because it&#8217;s fun. Yet it is also possible to ask whether everyone in the world
really <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">is </span>separated by only a few nodes in a vast network&#8212;a property of the social
life of human beings that may have quite extraordinary implications. In either
case, the object of study involves things that are made of discrete, enumerable
elements.

Note that under this definition any set is both a subset and a superset of itself. After all, any
element in a set (treating it as the first set) is an element in that set (treating it as the
second). In this situation, we say that the two sets are <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">equal</span><a 
 id="dx1-27008"></a>. The set {John, Paul, George,
Ringo} is neither a subset nor a superset of {Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul}, and so we
say that these two sets are not <a 
 id="dx1-27009"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">comparable</span>.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >  So is {a, e, i, o, u} a subset of the set of all vowels? Or to put it another way, is a whole
pie &#8220;part of&#8221; a pie? From a technical standpoint, every morsel of the pie is part of the entire
pie, so, mathematically, the answer would be &#8220;yes.&#8221; Intuitively and lingustically, this isn&#8217;t
what we mean by &#8220;part of&#8221; (or subset). To allow for the intuitive meaning of
superset and subset, we speak of a set being a <span

 id="dx1-27010"></a><a 
 id="dx1-27011"></a> (or <span

of another if-and-only-if the set is a subset (superset), but <span

 id="x1-290002.1.3"></a>Extensions of Sets</h4>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >As defined, sets are useful enough to represent many real-world things. There are cases,
however, where sets are simply not &#8220;structured&#8221; enough to describe the properties that
inhere in particular collections of objects. The two obvious examples of this involve
ordering and multiple elements.
<!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >  As formally defined, sets have no internal order. This is formalized in standard theory as
the <a 
 id="dx1-29001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">axiom of extensionality: </span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">if two sets X and Y have the same elements, then X = Y</span>; it
doesn&#8217;t matter whether I put the peanut butter or the jelly onto my sandwich first. But
sometimes one needs internal order: the participants in a race, for example, finish in a
specific order. To support this, we can introduce the idea of an <a 
 id="dx1-29002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">ordered pair</span>&#8212;a collection
of two elements in a specific order.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >  For example, the Olympic gold medalist at the 2008 men&#8217;s 200m butterfly was
the astonishing Michael Phelps. The silver and bronze went to Laszlo Cseh and
Takeshi Matsuda, respectively. If Cseh had been seven-tenths of a second faster, he
would have won gold (and Phelps would have won silver). The set of medalists
would have been the same, but of course, the order of finishing would have been
different.
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >  The notation for ordered pairs is similar to that used for sets; a set is written with curly
braces <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{}</span>, while an ordered pair is written with parentheses (). So <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,b</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">} </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">b,a</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">} </span>(since
both are sets and the elements are the same), but <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,b</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">)</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2260;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">b,a</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) </span>(since both are ordered pairs
and the order is different). And of course, <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,b</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">}</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2260;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,b</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) </span>(one is a set, the other an ordered
pair). Since ordered pairs can easily be assembled into a special kind of set, most of the
useful properties of sets are also true for ordered pairs. The generalization from ordered
pairs to ordered triples, quadruples, and so forth is fairly simple, and mathematicians will
often speak of an ordered <a 
 id="dx1-29003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">tuple </span>when the exact number of elements is unspecified or
unimportant. To continue the example above, the set of medalists {Cseh, Matsuda, Phelps}
would have remained the same, but the ordered triple (Phelps, Cseh, Masuda) would
have changed to (Cseh, Phelps, Matsuda) if Laszlo Cseh had been that tiny bit
faster.
<!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >  The same item sometimes appears several times in the same set-like collection; the
Beatles&#8217; instruments, for example, were <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span>guitar<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span> bass<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span> guitar<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span> drums<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">}</span>. Although this is disallowed in a set, it is allowed in a generalization
called a <a 
 id="dx1-29004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">multiset</span>. This is also easy to create using set primitives; a <a 
 id="dx1-29005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">multiset </span>is a set of
ordered pairs <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a,N</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">)</span>, where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a </span>is the element and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">N </span>is the number of times it occurs (the

<!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >One of the most important extensions to the notion of a set is the ability to make sets of sets
(i.e. sets whose members are themselves sets). We have, for example, just defined an

members are themselves ordered pairs&#8212;which in turn leads us to a particularly powerful
mathematical object called a <a

relations like the fourth one above to determine the best way to get from one city
to another. If Boston <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x25C7; </span>Pittsburgh (&#8220;Boston is related to Pittsburgh&#8221;), you can
get from here to there in a single flight, but otherwise you will have to change
planes. Similarly, we can ask the question &#8220;What do elephants eat?&#8221; using the
language of relations (in formal notation, &#8220;what are the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>such that (elephant, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">x)</span>
is in the eating-relation?&#8221; or &#8220;what are the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>such that elephant <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x25C7; </span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">x?&#8221;) </span>This is
precisely how relational databases work; they determine set membership using
&#8220;relations.&#8221;

<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >We have no reason to assume that elephants eat only one thing, or that only one thing eats
insects. There are, however, a large class of things where this relationship does hold: we
can probably assume that an object in a store has only one price, and that there is
only one combination of numbers that will open a particular combination lock.
This latter relationship is an important one&#8212;so important, that it gets its own
name.
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >  To formalize the concept a little further, we can introduce the idea of domain and range.
The <a 
 id="dx1-33001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">domain </span>of a relation (R) is the collection of all the first elements of the pairs
(in other words, <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">: (</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x,y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2208; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">R</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">}</span>). The <a 
 id="dx1-33002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">range </span>is the collection of all the second
elements: (<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">: (</span><span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">R</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">}</span>). The domain of the first example above is the store&#8217;s
entire inventory, while the range is the set of all the prices. (If the store is called
&#8220;Everything&#8217;s A Dollar,&#8221; for example, we expect the range to be the <a 
 id="dx1-33003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">singleton </span>set
{$1}.)
<!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >  A relation is called a <a 
 id="dx1-33004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">function </span>when there is a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">single </span>element of the range related to each
domain element. This captures our idea that every item has a price, and each item
has only one price. In fact, it captures our intuitive notion of the properties of an
item&#8212;we can talk about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>price of an orange or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>color of a car or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>address
of a house, in each case confident that a given item has only one such attribute
related to it. (By contrast, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>ancestor of a person is not a single set. Father-of is
typically a function, but parent-of, brother-of, child-of, or ancestor-of would not
be.)
<!--l. 254--><p class="indent" >  Because functions have only one range element associated with each
domain element, there is an alternative notation often used specifically
for functions. Instead of writing the relation symbol in between the two

 id="x1-33005f4"></a>
we write the relation symbol and the domain element and use that to represent the
corresponding range element. So, if Paul <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x25C7; </span>bass and <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x25C7; </span>is a function, then we can write <span

Paul or <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x25C7; </span>(Paul) to represent his bass. This is also the notation for &#8220;standard&#8221; mathematical
functions like <span

<!--l. 302--><p class="indent" >  What this relation (<span

classes: the class of odd numbers and the class of even numbers. All of the odd numbers are
related to each other (but not to any even numbers) and vice versa for the even numbers. In
general, equivalence relationships allow us to capture the idea of a group of interchangeable
objects that are nevertheless distinct from other kinds of items. Money is like this.
Any $5 bill is typically interchangeable with any other, different serial numbers
notwithstanding. But a $5 bill is not interchangeable with a $50 bill. Once again, we feel
compelled to mention that this is really one of the fundamental ideas forming
the basis of modern logic (through boolean logic) and modern computation (via
electronic circuit design). We&#8217;ll have more to say about this in the chapter on

<!--l. 332--><p class="indent" >  Graphic designers consider Harry Beck&#8217;s 1931 map of the London Underground to be
one of the great masterpieces of information visualization. Before Beck, maps of railway
networks tended be drawn over ordinary geographical maps, thus indicating both the
distance and the angle of orientation among stations. Beck was the one who realized that in
the context of a subway, such matters were mostly irrelevant. A traveler on the tube is
mainly concerned with figuring out how the stations are connected in order to find out
how many stops away something is and where (or whether) it is necessary to
switch trains. Beck&#8217;s method is now so widely imitated (nearly every subway
system in the world uses it), that it can be hard to see what&#8217;s so ingenious about it.
Beck essentially removed everything that didn&#8217;t matter. Lines lie along the major
compass points and stations are mostly equidistant, even though that is not at all
true of the actual physical stations. The result is a map that people can read in an
instant.
<!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >  The London Underground map, by boiling things down to what is essential, comes close
to defining the subway as (to use the concepts we set forth in the previous section)
a <span

class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">relation </span>that defines &#8220;connections&#8221; between
those objects. The tube map, to put it in mathematical terms, is a <a

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">graph</span>, and there
is an entire branch of mathematics devoted to studying the properties of such
structures.

<!--l. 368--><p class="indent" >  One of the simplest questions about a graph is whether or not it can be drawn without
overlapping lines. Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-370013">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:twohouses --></a> provides an example. In this figure, we have connected two
houses (vertices <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>) to three utilities (Gas, Water, and Power), while allowing each
utility to have its own right-of-way. We call this a <a 
 id="dx1-37002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">complete </span>graph; every house is
connected directly to every utility. Since no lines cross, there is no danger that a gas
technician will accidentally knock out the water to a house, and each house has its own
connection, so a short in house <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">A </span>won&#8217;t cut power to house <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>. The technical term for this
kind of graph is <a 
 id="dx1-37003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">planar graph</span>. All of the edges fit into a plane without overlapping or
crossing.

neighborhood. Notice that, as drawn, his power line crosses house <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>&#8217;s water line. But even
if you were to take a less direct path between <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C </span>and the power station, it wouldn&#8217;t
help; in fact, even if you snake in between house <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">A </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>, you still need to cross
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>&#8217;s gas line. If you ran <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C</span>&#8217;s water line across the top of the diagram instead of
around the bottom, you could then run his power line across the bottom&#8212;but
you&#8217;d still need to cross <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">A</span>&#8217;s water line. As it happens, this will always be the case
with three or more customers and three or more utilities, which is to say that
such graphs are not planar. We won&#8217;t bother to prove it, but it can be proven. As
you might expect, arriving at such proofs is a matter of great interest to graph
theorists.

<!--l. 426--><p class="indent" >  According to mathematical legend, the local citizens liked to take walks about the city

is, a set of &#8220;connected vertices&#8221;) that traverses every edge once and only once.
Euler managed to prove that it wasn&#8217;t possible, and the argument is fairly simple.
Suppose, for example, that you start on the central island (<span

bridges connecting to that island, you have to go off, then on, then off, then on, then
off. So if you start at <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B</span>. A similar
argument shows that if you start somewhere other than <span

<!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >  Now apply the same argument to the north shore (<span

three bridges as with five; if you start at <span

argument holds with any odd number of bridges. It holds equally with the south bank <span

if you start at <span

<!--l. 430--><p class="indent" >  But what this argument ends up saying is that you can&#8217;t start (or finish) anywhere. If you

However, it does have two unusual properties. First, although it doesn&#8217;t have
a Hamiltonian cycle, it does have a Hamiltonian path. Our salesman could go
through each city once and only once if she didn&#8217;t need to return to the home office
afterwards. Second, if you remove any vertex (and the edges running into it, of
course), the resulting graph is Hamiltonian and you can do the full circle. You can
verify these facts at your leisure. In the interests of full disclosure of the trivial, a
non-Hamiltonian graph that becomes Hamiltonian when you delete any vertex is called

almost doesn&#8217;t make sense; it has no edges, and so it&#8217;s not possible to remove one
[case (a)]. Similarly, a tree with only one vertex has no edges [case (b)] (since
that would have to be an edge from the one vertex to itself, which would be a
cycle&#8212;illegal in a tree). A tree with two vertices can only have one edge [case (c)], and if

Eventually, you come to a problem that&#8217;s so small you can solve it just by looking at
it (because the answer, mercifully, is obvious) and then build the answer to the
big problem from the smaller answers. (Sometimes computer programmers will

then read all of their papers and make a list of all of their co-authors, continue through their

pretty obvious and easy. So if one of your coauthors says &#8220;my number is a 1,&#8221;
then you know that your number is a 2. But more generally, if they don&#8217;t know
what their number is, then they can ask their co-authors, and their co-authors can
ask theirs, and so on. And whatever number they tell you&#8212;more formally, the
smallest number they tell you&#8212;is one less than your number. (In our cases, Patrick&#8217;s
co-author Christopher Hall is a 3. This makes Patrick a 4, and by extension Steve is a
5.)<span class="footnote-mark"><a

We therefore have a recursive definition of Erdös numbers. If you have written a paper with
Paul, your number is a one. Otherwise, your number is one more than the smallest number
of any of your co-authors.
<!--l. 575--><p class="indent" >  As another example, consider a simple safe with a programmable numeric keypad. One
way of getting into such a safe is simply to try all possible combinations until you get in. If
the combination is only one digit, there are ten possible combinations, and we can probably
get in in a few seconds. If the combination is two digits long, there are a hundred
possibilities, and it will take longer. But what if there are four digits? Or five? Or
ten?
<!--l. 577--><p class="indent" >  To solve this, notice that we can break up the combination like a phone number (think of
the difference between 345-8082 and <br 
class="newline" />3458082); if we have x + 1 digits in the combination, then that&#8217;s the same as if we had a
1-digit combination followed by an (x)-digit combination (3-458082). There are obviously
ten possibilities for a one digit combination, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Perhaps equally obviously,
if there are N combinations for an x-digit combination, then we can combine any of the
possible first digits with any of the possible ending combinations. This is simply the
Cartesian product defined earlier, and it produces a set of 10N possible (x + 1)-digit
combinations.

is the study of counting things, like the number of possible finishes in a race or the number
of &#8220;combinations&#8221; on a safe lock. Although this may seem a rather dull area, it (like
logic and set theory) forms a crucial foundation for many other math subfields.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s both crucial and accessible&#8212;the foundations and principles are easy to

<!--l. 692--><p class="indent" >  The most basic principle of combinatorics is the idea of the <a

plates in Pennsylvania used to have three (capital) letters followed by three digits.
There are 26 letters and 10 digits, and hence <span

there were eventually not going to be enough plates to go around. At five to ten

state, therefore, added a fourth digit to the license numbers, so there are now

<!--l. 694--><p class="indent" >  A slightly harder case emerges when the events are not completely independent. If the
first letter on your license plate is a &#8216;P,&#8217; nothing prevents the second from being a

well. This case yields the factorial we saw in the previous section. If there are

 id="dx1-47003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">permutation</span>: a rearrangement of a collection of objects.
We could ask, for example, how many different ways there are to rearrange a set of seven
crayons, or how many different seating arrangements there are for a dinner party of
twelve people. In general, if there are <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>items that need to be placed, there are
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">! </span>different permutations. But things can get tricky if not all objects need to be
placed.
<!--l. 698--><p class="indent" >  Returning to the race example: Let&#8217;s suppose that we have a race with 20 competitors.
Discounting ties, there are 20! different possibilities for the total order of finishing. But in
this case, we are giving medals only to the top three finishers, and we just want to know
how many different ways there are to distribute the medal.
<!--l. 700--><p class="indent" >  We can use a similar argument to the one from the previous section: any of 20 people
could have won the gold medal. Anyone except the gold medalist&#8212;any of 19
people&#8212;could have taken the silver, and anyone except the gold or silver medalist&#8212;any of
18 people&#8212;could have taken the bronze. So there are <span

6,840 instead of the trillions of complete lists.

ignore, because we don&#8217;t care about them). But this is true no matter who the three

no longer matters, we can permute the winning triple in any of 3! different ways while still

numerical problems to an investigation of the structures and relationships that govern
mathematics itself. That, in fact, is what contemporary mathematicians mean when they
speak of algebra (sometimes referring to it as Abstract Algebra or Modern Algebra to
distinguish it from its grade-school cousin). With al-Khw<span class="bar-css">a</span>rizm<span class="bar-css"><img

  The answer is assuredly &#8220;Parliament,&#8221; and we could perform the same logical deduction
with respect to the Israeli Knesset, the Russian Duma, the Irish Houses of the Oireachtas,
and with the governing bodies of dozens of nation states. But what, precisely, is
the relationship we are talking about? Is it possible to generalize this kind of
relationship beyond the narrow realm of comparative political structures&#8212;perhaps
into areas that have nothing at all to do with politics or nations? What are the
properties that persist in other structures that are superficially similar, but not quite the
same?
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  Another example of this can be seen in the &#8220;sudoku&#8221; puzzles that have recently become

three-by-three subsquare has more than one of each digit. We provide you with one

<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >  When you inspect a sudoku puzzle closely, it becomes apparent that even though there
are numbers in the grid, it is not actually a &#8220;number&#8221; puzzle at all. It is really a puzzle
that involves coming up with patterns that fulfill certain specified conditions.
Instead of using numbers (as in figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-490021">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sudoku:numbers --></a>), we could pose the same problem with
anything for which we could produce nine different variations. We could use
the letters A&#8211;I, the positions on a baseball team (figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-490032">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sudoku:baseball --></a>), or the nine Muses
(figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-490043">3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sudoku:muses --></a>).

<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >  This suggests that there is at least one structural property that is entirely independent of
the specifics of sudoku as commonly played. Are there other such properties? Do those
properties change as the grid gets larger? Would the essential properties be different if
played amid a set of interlocking triangles or on the surface of a sphere? Are there other
games that are reducible to the essential structure of sudoku (despite seeming entirely
unrelated)?
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >  Insight into essential relationship&#8212;the quest for those things that do not vary among
outward forms&#8212;has often been the source of great breakthroughs in mathematics. René
Descartes (1596&#8211;1650) provided one of the more striking examples in his work with the
coordinate system that bears his name (Cartesian coordinates). Before Descartes, geometry
and arithmetic were studied separately, and the properties of geometric objects like
ellipses and parabolas were defined as geometric properties of points and distances.
Descartes&#8217;s great insight was to think of these objects as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sets of numbers, </span>which in turn
allowed him to describe their properties via arithmetic. This made it possible, for
example, to determine where two curves intersected by describing the equations of
the two curves and solving for the numbers incorporated into both. Instead of
drawing lines (and likely making mistakes along the way), we became able to
solve geometric problems using arithmetic methods with clear, demonstrable
solutions.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >  Realizing that one could describe the properties of space in terms of the properties of
numbers ultimately entailed an intuition about the structure that underlies both geometry
and arithmetic, and which has some of the same form as the questions we just posed about
analogies and sudoku. In the case of Descartes&#8217;s insight, the effect was a revolution in
mathematical understanding. We refer to the subfield created by these insights, accurately
and appropriately, as &#8220;algebraic geometry.&#8221;

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Conceiving things algebraically usually involves an attempt to discern the fundamental
properties of a given set of mathematical objects. One of the most essential instances
of such generalization in algebra is the idea of an <a 
 id="dx1-51001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">operation</span>, which is simply
a procedure that produces an &#8220;output&#8221; value when given one or more &#8220;input&#8221;
values.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >  This is closely related to the idea of a function, as introduced in the previous chapter.
Suppose we have a set <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span>, and define <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>as the set of ordered pairs of elements in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span>. We
can create a function from this set <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>to the set <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>itself, thus defining a &#8220;binary
operation&#8221; on this set.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >  For example: Addition takes two numbers and returns a third. Given the pair of numbers
(4, 3), the operation +(4,3) [normally written as 4+3] is of course 7. But that&#8217;s not the only
example of a binary operation. Subtraction is also a binary operation, as is multiplication,
and so forth. But we could also define the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">max </span>operation as a binary operation that
returns the larger of the two numbers, so <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">max</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(4</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">3) </span>would be 4. It is also possible to
define binary operations on things other than numbers. We could let <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>be &#8220;the set
of muses,&#8221; in which case a sample drawn from <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>would be one of the pairs
(say, Clio and Terpsichore). We could then define a function <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>as &#8220;the first of
the pair in alphabetical order.&#8221; In this case <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span>Clio, Terpsichore<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) </span>would be Clio.
Similarly, if we define <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>as the set of dates, and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>as the &#8220;the latter of the pair&#8221;, then
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(5</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2215;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">12</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2215;</span><span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2215;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">2014) </span>would be in summer 2014. (Oddly enough, it would be in
summer 2014 regardless of whether you read them as European-style or American-style
dates.)
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >  We could generalize the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">max </span>function to take more than two arguments, so <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">max</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(3</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">5</span><span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">,</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">9)</span>
would be 9. But since it now takes more than two arguments, it ceases to be a binary
operation. Alternatively, we could define an operation that goes from one set to a different
set&#8212;for example, an operation that takes a pair of dates and returns the number of days
between them. But since &#8220;a number of days&#8221; isn&#8217;t itself a date, that would not fit the
definition we gave above.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >  For reasons that will become apparent, we usually use a slightly different notation for
these functions, putting a funny symbol (we&#8217;ll use <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218;</span>) between the two elements of the pair
instead of surrounding the pair with <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">()</span>, like so: Clio <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>Terpsichore. So with the definitions
above (where we take the alphabetically earlier of the pair), Clio <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>Terpsichore <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">=</span>
Clio.
<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >  From the discussion above, it should be obvious that if the two arguments to the function
are in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span>, the function value itself will also be in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span>. In this case, we say that that this function
<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>is &#8220;closed&#8221; over <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>(i.e. exhibits the <a 
 id="dx1-51002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">closure </span>property). This makes intuitive sense
and is an important property of many kinds of numbers. For example, if you add
two positive numbers, you get a positive number&#8212;the operation &#8220;addition&#8221; is
closed over the positive numbers. If you multiply two integers, the result is an
integer&#8212;the operation &#8220;multiplication&#8221; is closed over the integers. However, division is
not&#8212;you can divide one integer by another and get a result that isn&#8217;t an integer (like
<img 
src="main41x.png" alt="2
3"  class="frac" align="middle">).
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >  From the closure properties, it follows that the function can be <a 
 id="dx1-51003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">composed</span>&#8212;that is,
applied several times in succession. For example, and still using the notation we&#8217;ve been
developing, the expression
  <table 
class="equation-star"><tr><td>
  <center class="math-display" >
<img 
src="main42x.png" alt="(Clio&#x2218; Terpsichore)&#x2218; Euterpe

<!--l. 126--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >is (because Clio <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>Terpsichore <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span>Clio) the same as
  <table

<!--l. 132--><p class="nopar" >

<!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >  In general, any closed function can be composed like this. But in addition, the <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218;</span>
function we&#8217;ve been describing has another important property: it doesn&#8217;t matter
how we group the elements before composing the function&#8212;a property known
generally as <a 
 id="dx1-51004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">associativity</span>. (A function with the associativity property is said to be

Stripped of the technical language, a group is a set of items and a structured way
of getting from one item to another. This could be something like adding two

<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >  There are two other criteria.

<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >  Now, why do we care? Why are we doing this? In essence, by defining a thing called a
group, we are generalizing (and capturing most of the key properties of) addition. Instead
of talking about what happens with particular numbers, we are providing a robust
description of the structure and set of relationships that characterize the &#8220;system&#8221; that the
numbers represent. What&#8217;s more, any system that can be represented by a group is one in
which our intuitive understandings of (the operation known as) addition can be usefully
deployed.
<!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >  If the muses as defined do not form a group, what does? Classical examples of groups
include things like the set of integers (with respect to addition), the set of real numbers
(with respect to addition), and so forth. An interesting non-classical example is simply a
clock&#8212;or more accurately, time as represented on a clock.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >  Clock arithmetic does not follow the rules of ordinary arithmetic. Consider the following
story problem: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Susan has a curfew of 10 o&#8217;clock. If she is fifteen hours late, what time</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">does she get home? </span>She doesn&#8217;t get home at 10+15=25 o&#8217;clock; no such time
exists.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main23.html#fn2x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-52003f2"></a>
However, we can use the rules of the group as applied to clock arithmetic to figure out that
she gets home at 1:00 the next day.
<!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >  Notice, first, that the set of times is well-defined, and second, that adding any time to any
other time still yields a time. Second, notice that adding 12 hours to a time does not
change the time (as expressed on the clock). More formally, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S </span>in this case is a time
or duration, and <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>is simply adding two times/durations and subtracting 12 as
necessary when one passes 12 o&#8217;clock. This is clearly closed and composable.
Furthermore,
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>is associative, since adding durations can be done in any order
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">12:00 is an identity element that does not change the time; <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">12 : 00 = </span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>as
      needed.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Any number of hours after 12:00 has an inverse in that many hours before. We
      can see, for example, that the inverse of 3:00 is 9:00 and vice-versa, since 3:00
      <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2218; </span>9:00 <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span>12:00.</li></ul>
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >If we understand addition of integers, then by extension we understand the extension of
addition to clock arithmetic and can apply our understanding in a new domain. In fact, the
idea of &#8220;clock arithmetic&#8221; crops up in many areas of science, including physics, computer
science, and cryptography.
<!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >  Another key insight relates to the idea of the group structure itself. Once we have
identified a particular group structure, it may be possible to relate that structure to
the structure of other groups. For example, one group may be <a 
 id="dx1-52004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">isomorphic </span>to
another if there is a mapping between the two groups that preserves the group
structure.
<!--l. 202--><p class="indent" >  Another example: Any ten year old is familiar with the idea of a &#8220;remainder;&#8221; when you
divide one number by another number, they may not go &#8220;evenly&#8221; (for example, 22 divided
by 4 is 5, with &#8220;remainder&#8221; 2). Mathematicians have formalized this notion as the <a 
 id="dx1-52005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">modulus</span>
operator, written &#8220;<a 
 id="dx1-52006"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">mod</span>.&#8221; 22 mod 4, for example, is 2&#8212;because the remainder is 2 when
you divide 22 by 4. This simple operation turns out to be useful in a variety of contexts,
precisely because it can model math in restricted domains such as on the face of a
clock.
<!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >  For example, letting <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">S</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032; </span>be the set of numbers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,<br 
class="newline" />10,11}, table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-520071">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: table:mod12 --></a> shows how the numbers can be added (mod 12). 5 + 8, for example,
becomes not 13, but 1, because 13 mod 12 is 1. This table can be seen to describe
the same relationship as clock arithmetic, with one single change: the number
12:00 is described as 0, not 12. We can therefore say that addition mod 12 is an
isomorphism of clock arithmetic, and that they both represent the same group in
some abstract sense. It therefore makes sense to talk about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>group of addition
mod 12 (since there is only one), whether it&#8217;s represented by numbers, a clock
face, or some bizarre variant on the 12 gods of Olympus where Hera + Apollo =
Ares.

<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >  Formally speaking, a <a 
 id="dx1-53001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">ring </span>is a group with two composition functions instead of just one,
normally written as <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">+ </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x22C5;</span>. These properties are supposed to capture our intuitions about
addition and multiplication, respectively. With respect to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">+</span>, a ring is a normal group, with
one additional property: namely, that it &#8220;commutes&#8221; (exhibits the <a 
 id="dx1-53002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">commutative </span>property).
This means that for all elements <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">b</span>, <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a</span>; it doesn&#8217;t matter which
order they come in. Any group that commutes like this is called an &#8220;abelian&#8221;
group.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Not all groups are abelian, as we&#8217;ll see later. But integers are, and all rings are by definition.
The identity element for <span

<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >  As a minor point, we&#8217;ve established that the first function (<span

As a simple example, the polynomials of a given variable (say, <span

elements like <span

or multiply them in our normal way; any system we can describe with polynomials can
therefore be operated upon as if it were just numbers, provided that we restrict the
operations we perform. We can&#8217;t always divide one polynomial by another, but rings don&#8217;t
require this.
<!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >  Another example of a ring is the set of integers modulo 12 (as above). This has already
been shown to be a group, but it takes little imagination to see that it&#8217;s also a ring, where
multiplication has its normal interpretation. In other words, 3 <span

divide&#8212;but that only calls attention to the relationship that is missing and to the peculiarity

<!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >  A field is arguably the most important algebraic structure, because it captures most of the

integers). However, fractions do (the inverse&#8212;the &#8220;reciprocal&#8221;&#8212;of 2 is just <img

They do not, however, form a field. To see why, consider the multiplicative inverse of 2
(<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">2</span><sup><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-90">-</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">1</span></sup> or <img

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">1</span></sup> <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 1</span>. However, as we can
see from table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-540022">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: table:mod12notfield --></a>, no such value exists. There is also no value such that <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 1</span>. In fact,
there are many such holes in the table; there&#8217;s no pair that will give you 3, either. What we
see instead is that, for example, the expression <span

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span>8 has two values for <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>that satisfy
it. Similarly, the 2 <span

This idea of a &#8220;zero divisor&#8221;&#8212;two nonzero numbers that multiply to give you
zero&#8212;turns out to be algebraically important. The numbers you learned about in
school don&#8217;t have any zero divisors. The idea violates some of our long-held
intuitions about numbers; for example, if in school, we were asked to &#8220;solve the
equation&#8221;

know something about the structure of a ring, and we know that the ring we&#8217;re studying has
no zero divisors&#8212;that&#8217;s given in the problem statement. We have to show that every
element has an inverse; we do this by picking a single element, without caring which one
it is, and showing that the element we picked has an inverse. But because the
element we picked could have been any element whatsoever, it doesn&#8217;t matter which
element we pick&#8212;they all have inverses. The <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>is therefore just a placeholder
for an element of a structure; we may not know anything about that element in
particular, but we know enough about the structure in which it is embedded to
determine certain properties that it must have. Research in mathematics (and
specifically in algebra) is more or less all about finding new properties that are
implicit in a given structure. These properties, moreover, help define ways of
abstracting the real, physical world in ways that can be modeled and intelligently
manipulated.
<!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >  So now that we have this rather abstract statement in the theorem above, what does it
really mean? Among its other implications, it gives us a way to figure out whether or not
something is a field. It also gives us (via a corollary we offer without proof) a way of
constructing fields if we need them.

<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >There are a few classical examples of algebraic structure derived from pure mathematics
with which you should be familiar. In many cases, these are the type-models from which
the concepts such as group and ring were derived.

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2115;</span>, the natural numbers, are the non-negative counting numbers starting from 0,
      i.e. (0,1,2,&#x2026;). These numbers do not form any of the algebraic structures (such
      as groups) discussed in this chapter. In particular, note that although 0 is an
      additive identity over this set (e.g. <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">1+0 = 1</span>), and the set is closed under both
      addition and multiplication (both operations on the set yield other elements
      within the set), numbers other than 0 do not have additive or multiplicative
      inverses in this set, since there aren&#8217;t any negative numbers.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2124;</span>,  the  integers,  are  produced  by  extending  the  set  <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2115;  </span>to  include  negative
      integers. This forms a ring under the ordinary interpretations of addition and
      multiplication, but not a field because most numbers don&#8217;t have multiplicative
      inverses.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211A;</span>,  the  rational  numbers,  are  produced  by  taking  ratios  of  two  integers
      (elements of <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2124;</span>). They form a full-fledged field.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D;</span>, the real numbers, are an extension of the rationals to close it under other
      operations (for example, taking square roots of positive numbers). It includes
      not only the rational numbers, but the irrational numbers (such as <img 
src="main52x.png" alt="&#x221A; --
  2"  class="sqrt" >), which
      cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Like <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211A;</span>, they also form a field.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">I</span>,  the  irrational  numbers,  are  all  of  the  members  of  <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D; </span>that  are  not  rational
      numbers (<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2208; </span><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211A;</span>). This is specifically not even a group, as the number 0 is not an
      irrational number, so there is no additive identity element.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span>, the complex numbers, are a field that extends <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D; </span>to include square roots of
      negative numbers as well. Unless you already have a good math background,
      this one is probably not familiar to you, but it&#8217;s important because you can
      do  things  in  it  that  you  can&#8217;t  do  in  <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D;</span>.  In  <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102;</span>,  every  polynomial,  including
      apparently unsolvable ones like <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><sup><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span></sup><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">+1 = 0</span>, have solutions. This will turn out to
      be important, for instance, in chapter 6, when we discover that some systems
      of equations only have solutions if you use complex numbers, and yet these
      solutions correspond closely to the physical world.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Imaginary numbers are the counterpart to real numbers in <span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2102; </span>although they have
      no standard symbol by themselves. These are the numbers produced by taking
      the square root of a negative (real) number. By convention, the square root of
      -1 is called &#8216;i&#8217;; The square root of -4 is therefore 2i, and the square root of -0.25
      is 0.5i. Imaginary numbers form a group under addition (2i + 2i = 4i), but are
      not a ring or a field.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x211D; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">-{</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">} </span>is an interesting group, produced by taking the field of real numbers
      and ignoring 0. This forms a group under multiplication, but not a ring.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="msbm-10x-x-120">&#x2124;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2215;n</span><span

 id="x1-570003.3.2"></a>Vectors</h4>
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" >Other applications of algebra incorporate structure in things other than just pure numbers.
One of the simplest non-numeric structures is the &#8220;vector.&#8221; A <a 
 id="dx1-57001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">vector </span>is simply a ordered
collection of arbitrary objects. Often the elements in a vector will themselves be numbers,
but they can be almost anything. For example, a set of directions, like the output of a
program like MapQuest, is a vector of &#8220;turns.&#8221; Such structures appear in some form in most
programming languages as a way of holding ordered collections of objects for
later manipulation. Computer scientists sometimes call this kind of structure a
&#8220;container.&#8221;
<!--l. 392--><p class="indent" >  Vectors are often used to represent positions. For example, positions on a globe (latitude
and longitude) can be represented by a two-place vector. London, for example, is at latitude
52N, longitude 0W, while New York City is at 41N, 74W. Letting positive numbers denote
north latitude and west longitude, we could equally describe the cities&#8217; locations as (52,0)
and (41,74) respectively. Amsterdam is at (52,-4), Ankara is at (42,-32), and Perth is at
(-32,-116). Alternatively, one can use the same notation to describe trips. A trip five degrees
due west would be represented as (0,5). One can then do addition and subtraction on the
individual components to determine differences between locations. Traveling five
degrees west (0,5), and three degrees north (3,0) would result in an overall trip of
(3,5). The difference between New York and Amsterdam is (-11, 78), meaning
that to fly from Amsterdam to New York, you would need to head in an overall
direction just south of west until you had covered 11 degrees of latitude and 78 of
longitude.
<!--l. 394--><p class="indent" >  Such position vectors are structured as a group. Any two elements can be added by
independently adding the components of the vector; the sum of two vectors represents the
overall position you get by making two trips in succession. The inverse of a vector can be
obtained by taking the inverse of the individual components; the &#8220;identity&#8221; vector (0,0)
represents traveling no distance whatsoever.
<!--l. 396--><p class="indent" >  Of course, vectors can be used in other ways. The Manhattan street layout lends itself
well to a two-dimensional vector, as does a chessboard. The vector (-2,1) could be used to
represent one of the possible moves of the knight. A bishop can move only diagonally,
which we can represent by the abstract vector scheme (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span>,<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span>) or (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span>,<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">-</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span>) (thus capturing the
idea that the change in rank must be equal to the change in file). White pawns, of course,
have only (1,0) as their move except when they capture using (1,1) or (1,-1) or when they
move (2,0) initially.
<!--l. 398--><p class="indent" >  Vectors can have as many places as one needs; moving around in three dimensions
as a rocket or a plane might can be captured using a three-place vector (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span>,<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span>,<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span>).
Alternatively, the elements of a vector may not represent physical dimensions,
but different abstract elements of an idea. For example, the inventory of an ice
cream shop might be represented by a fifty-element vector, with the numbers
representing the number of gallons of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, coffee, etc. in stock.
Adding vectors would change the stock, as people buy ice cream and new supplies
arrive.
<!--l. 400--><p class="indent" >  It&#8217;s fairly easy to formalize these concepts with a strict mathematical definition. An
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n</span>-place vector <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a </span>is an ordered collection of <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">a</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">n</span></sub>). Vectors are
added (using any addition operation valid for the underlying objects) by adding together
corresponding elements:

<!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" >This operation is closed over the set of vectors and is obviously associative if the

group.

<!--l. 425--><p class="indent" >  So why are vectors a group and not a ring or a field? Although the idea of
adding vectors makes intuitive sense and is well-defined, it doesn&#8217;t make quite as
much sense to talk about multiplying New York by London. Although scalar
multiplication, above, is well-defined, you can&#8217;t use this operation to multiply one
vector by another in all circumstances, as a ring would require. The standard
definition of multiplying one vector by another does not fulfill the definition of a
ring.
<!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >  In particular, vector multiplication (multiplying one vector by another) is usually defined
as the sum of the individual element products:

In this formulation, the product of a vector and a vector is not a vector, but just a single
number, and hence vectors are not closed under multiplication. Of course, nothing stops
someone from defining a different, non-standard, multiplication algorithm for
vector-on-vector multiplication, but so far there has not been any real need or
application.

main problem is that while many matrices have inverses, not all do. The matrices that do
not have inverses correspond to systems of equations that don&#8217;t have solutions. But because
systems that can be solved correspond to matrices that do have inverses, we can use normal
rules of arithmetic to solve complex problems involving not just single numbers, but huge
groups of them.

the same permutations in a different order can yield different results. For example, consider
the following two permutations: (2, 1, 3, 4) and (1, 3, 2, 4), essentially swapping the
first two and the middle two elements, respectively. Notice that the results of
these two permutations are different when applied in a different order to the same

many applications in science, technology, and business, doing steps in the most
efficient way possible is crucial to getting the best possible results as fast as possible.
Permutations provide an abstraction for studying this problem. Permutations are also

endpoints, a triangle by its three corners, and a heptakaidecahedron by &#x2026;whatever

transformations that can be employed in the visualization of such structures, including
moving objects in space, magnifying or reducing them, and projecting them onto a

<!--l. 796--><p class="indent" >  There are other forms of affine transformations that have not been discussed here for
reasons of brevity: shears and reflections among others. Our discussion has been limited to
two dimensions for the same reason, but images or representations in three dimensions (or

transforming a (round) globe to a (flat) map or vice versa is a good example. Topology, as

<!--l. 802--><p class="noindent" >A final important use of the structures of algebra can be found in the field of cryptology,
since algebra forms the foundation for most modern cryptographic algorithms.
Unfortunately, the people who really understand the algebra and algorithms in detail aren&#8217;t
allowed to talk about it. However, some historical examples can serve to illustrate the
relationship between codes, ciphers, and mathematical structure.
<!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >  And really, we don&#8217;t have to go very far back, because this relationship was only recently
discovered. Prior to about 1930, codemaking and codebreaking was dominated, not by
mathematicians and computer programmers, but by linguists and literature scholars who
were familiar with the structure of language. Cryptography provides a way to hide the
structure of language behind a mathematical structure, but understanding the structure of
language is still key.
<!--l. 806--><p class="indent" >  In particular, note that &#8220;coding&#8221; in general, forms a group. Any process that you use to
muddle letters and words up can be repeated or composed with any other process, including
the &#8220;null&#8221; process of not doing anything. This null cipher, in which you cleverly replace &#8216;a&#8217;
by &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;b&#8217; by &#8216;b&#8217;, &#8216;c&#8217; by &#8216;c&#8217;, and so forth, is obviously the identity element in this group.
Furthermore, to be useful, a code or cipher must be invertible, so that you can decode it and
figure out what the original message was. These are, of course, the defining properties of
groups.
<!--l. 808--><p class="indent" >  Within this large group are several subgroups that can be individually addressed.
For example, one classical cipher is the transposition cypher, where the letters
in a message are unchanged but moved about. One common method for doing
this involves writing the message into a set of ten or so columns and then
writing the columns from top to bottom. The message &#8220;Only mad dogs and
Englishmen go out in the noonday sun&#8221; is placed in columns as in the diagram

countries facing Germany. It was actually Poland, however, that produced the first
algebraic attack on the Enigma and helped create the first generation of mathematical
cryptologists.
<!--l. 881--><p class="indent" >  The Enigma is an example of an electromechanical cipher machine of the sort that were
popular in the early twentieth century. In appearance, it looked rather like a typewriter with
a set of lights attached. The user would set a &#8220;key&#8221; through a set of wires, plugs, and
rotating wheels, then press the keys for the message he wanted to send; the lights would
light up corresponding to the ciphertext for each letter. Decryption operated in exactly the
same way.

would send an electrical signal through a set of plugs in a plugboard, then through a set of
rotating wheels, then back through the plugboard in reverse until it lighted a lamp. The
variable connections created by the plugboard did a very effective job of masking the
individual letters used in the message (like a newspaper cryptogram), but did not hide the
frequency or structural properties. The rotating wheels, however, ensured that each letter of
the message was encrypted like a separate newspaper cryptogram, essentially masking
these self-same frequency properties. The combined effect was, to say the least,
formidable.
<!--l. 890--><p class="indent" >  Marion Rejewski (1905&#8211;1980), a Polish mathematician, made history precisely by
recognizing the algebraic structure inherent in this system. Either of the two parts, the
plugboard or the rotating wheels, could be solved relatively quickly and easily,
because of the information they did not mask. Could these two parts be separated in
practice?

the not-too-difficult plugboard cipher, and thus reveal the secrets of the German
military.
<!--l. 900--><p class="indent" >  This incident in some regards marks the turning point in the history of cryptography;
today cryptography is largely dominated by mathematicians, precisely because of their
knowledge of mathematical structure. The RSA algorithm that keeps much of the Internet
secure, for example, is a simple expression of a few number-theoretic properties of the
group structure of <span

examining these methods in light of linguistic and literary structure, appropriately modeled

<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >On November 9th, 1965, over thirty-million people lost power across an area that extended
from New York and New Jersey, through New England, and into parts of southern
Ontario&#8212;an area comprising some 80,000 square miles. On November 10th, <span

<span

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >There have been power outages of similar magnitude since, but for many New Yorkers, it

<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Part of its fame undoubtedly arises from a headline the <span

the day) later, on August 10th, 1966:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >BIRTHS UP NINE MONTHS AFTER THE BLACKOUT.</div>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >The story that followed made the case plain:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >A sharp increase in births has been reported by several large hospitals
      here, 9 months after the 1965 blackout.
      <!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Mount Sinai Hospital, which averages 11 births daily, had 18 births on
      Monday. This was a record for the hospital; its previous one-day high
      was 18. At Bellevue there were 29 new babies in the nursery yesterday,
      compared with 11 a week ago and an average of 20.</div>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >The sharp rise seemed to be ubiquitous: Mount Sinai, Columbia Presbyterian, St.
Vincent&#8217;s, Brookdale, Coney Island&#8212;all reported above average numbers of births (the
author of the article, Martin Tolchin, noted that &#8220;New York and Brooklyn Jewish
hospitals reported that their number of births was normal&#8221;). As a matter of due
diligence, he asked a number of sociologists and obstetricians for their comments.
One sociologist explained the matter succinctly: &#8220;The lights went out and people
were left to interact with one another.&#8221; Others reacted with some skepticism,
eager to &#8220;see the data for the entire city:&#8221; &#8220;If it should be true, I would think it is
because people may have had trouble finding their accustomed contraceptives
&#x2026;.&#8221;
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  Five years later, the demographer J. Richard Udry published a three-page scholarly
article with the following terse abstract:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >A comparison of the number of births in New York City nine months
      after  the  Great  Blackout  of  1965  with  comparable  periods  for  the
      previous  five  years  shows  no  increase  in  births  associated  with  the
      blackout. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xudry:effect">11</a>]</span></div>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >The method by which he arrived at this conclusion was bracingly simple. Taking November
10th, 1965 as the date of conception, he then assumed the average gestational length to be
280 days from the last menstrual period (thus 266 or 267 days from conception). He then
determined, using government records on vital statistics, that about ninety percent of the
babies conceived on November 10th would have been born between June 27th and
August 14th. If there were an unusually high number of conceptions on November
10th, it followed that this entire period would contain a higher number of births
relative to previous years. But when he took those numbers (for the previous
five years), he discovered that the given period during 1966 wasn&#8217;t in any way
remarkable. In fact, the percentage of births during the dates in question held steady, at
around 13.9 percent, from 1961 to 1966. Blackout babies, in other words, were a
myth.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  It would be easy to read this story as a cautionary tale about the misuse of statistics. But
for us, this episode says much more about the conditions that prevail whenever statistics are
used. The point of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">New York Times </span>article, after all, was not merely to make the case for
blackout babies, but to say something about human beings and human priorities. Without
the comforts of modern technology, we turn to one another&#8212;a sad commentary on our
attachment to television, but a hopeful commentary on our basic predispositions and
possible return. Since this idea is couched in the language of science (Tolchin
spends three full paragraphs recounting the data he was able to gather from various
hospitals), everyone follows suit. The sociologist speaks of people &#8220;interacting,&#8221; when
it is obvious to everyone that &#8220;gettin&#8217; busy&#8221; is the real state of affairs. Another
requests better data; we&#8217;re talking about facts here. And facts, of course, license
what might in another context be understood as a cruel, anti-Semitic slur: Jewish
people, alas, are not so prone to cuddling with one another when the lights go
out.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  Udry, too, is telling a story, and he is clearly the hero: the scientist, armed with proper
understanding of the facts, triumphs over the anecdotal impressions of the untrained. After
setting forth his own numbers, he adds:
      <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Let  us  not  imagine  that  a  simple  statistical  analysis  such  as  this  will
      lay to rest the myth of blackout babies. [&#x2026;] It is evidently pleasing to
      many  people  to  fantasy  [sic.]  that  when  people  are  trapped  by  some
      immobilizing event which deprives them of their usual activities, most
      will turn to copulation.</div>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >People, in other words, are not just untrained, but willfully delusional. They will persist in
their attachment to fantasy in the face of incontrovertible evidence. Like the sociologists, he
cannot even allow himself an unadorned reference to sex. The people to which he is
referring &#8220;copulate.&#8221; Like farm animals.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >  Discussions of probability and statistics often begin by restating an old bromide: &#8220;There
are lies, damn lies, and statistics.&#8221; This quote, which has been variously attributed to
Benjamin Disraeli, Mark Twain, Lord Courtney, and probably a dozen others besides,
would seem either to dismiss the entire subject as fatuous trickery, or to encourage us to
look behind every curtain for falsehood masquerading as truth. We think it would be
better to acknowledge that no area of mathematics is more insistently connected to
narrative. The question that has to proceed &#8220;Am I being lied to?&#8221; is &#8220;What story am
I being told?&#8221; And for the prospective statistician: &#8220;What story am I trying to
tell?&#8221;
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  We doubt that any reader of this book needs to be reminded that statistics has
been used in the service of many dangerous ideas (the example about Jewish
hospitals above recalls considerably more frightening uses of statistics only a few
decades previously). But undue emphasis on the damned lies can obscure the
extraordinary power of statistical methods. If they are good at deceiving, they are
likewise good at yielding insights in fields ranging from biology to linguistics.
The connection between statistics and narrative may well be the most important
point of intersection between mathematics and the humanities. And in this case, it
may be that the former has as much to glean from the latter as the other way
around.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-660004.1"></a>Probability</h3>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Everything about statistics depends upon the principles of probability. The modern study of
this subject originated, as so many good things do, with a bar bet. Specifically, &#8220;How do
you settle an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">interrupted </span>series of bets between equally skilled players?&#8221; Phrasing the
problem in modern terms, suppose that Floyd and Sam are playing a best-of-nine series,
where the first one to get five points wins the overall bet. Unfortunately, someone&#8217;s
phone rings and the game is broken up when Floyd is leading 3&#8211;2. It wouldn&#8217;t
be fair to give Floyd all the money (since Sam hasn&#8217;t actually lost yet), but it
also wouldn&#8217;t be fair simply to split the money evenly, since Floyd does have an
advantage.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >  The problem sounds simple, but it had been discussed for well over a century before it
was brought to the attention of one of the best mathematicians of the seventeenth century,
Blaise Pascal (1623&#8211;1662). His answer laid the foundations for what would become
modern probability theory.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >  First, he pointed out that the series can&#8217;t last longer than four more games, since it&#8217;s a
best-of-nine and they&#8217;ve already played five. Second, he pointed out that each
game has two possible outcomes; either Floyd will win, or Sam will. How many
ways can these four games be divided? Pascal identified sixteen possibilities,
enumerated here. (We use the notation F for a win for Floyd, and S for a win for Sam.)

know that the first die <span

in that row, and that a total of two (for example) is strictly impossible. Within that row,
there are only six possible outcomes, and the chance of (for example) rolling a 10 is
<img

<!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >  We can thus distinguish between &#8220;the probability of rolling a 10 total&#8221; (which can be

and we are allowed to know those conditions. On the other hand, if the first die
was a 1 (the first line of the table), there is no chance whatsoever of getting a
10 total. This distinction nicely illustrates the idea of conditional probability; if
we have prior knowledge that restricts the possible <a

<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >Unfortunately, the probability framework developed above doesn&#8217;t capture many of our
philosophical notions of probability. For example, what was the &#8220;probability&#8221; of the
Brazilian national team winning the World Cup in 2006? At the start of the competition,
they were heavily favored (a judgment borne partially by statistics, and partially by a
general, intuitive sense of which team was better). We know in hindsight that they didn&#8217;t
win, but since the 2006 World Cup is a one-off event, there&#8217;s no way to make statements
like &#8220;they will win <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>out of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y </span>times.&#8221; The frequentist or classical idea suggests what
will happen over a repeating series of 2006 World Cups&#8212;which is obviously
nonsensical.
<!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >  But there&#8217;s another way to interpret the idea of probability: not in terms of frequency, but
in terms of &#8220;degree of belief.&#8221; If I say that something has a probability of 0.90 (or &#8220;is 90%
likely to happen&#8221;), I&#8217;m saying (among other things) that I think it&#8217;s substantially more
likely to happen than not to happen, even if we&#8217;re talking about a one-off event. In the case
of a past event, I&#8217;m saying that I wasn&#8217;t very surprised that it happened, or alternatively that
I was really surprised that it didn&#8217;t. Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t be as surprised if I said it was
only 60% likely. (And specifically, if I say something like &#8220;90% likely,&#8221; then
I&#8217;m implicitly stating that I think a bet at 9:1 odds would be a fair bet on that
event.)

<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s suppose that investigators are looking at a fire in a restaurant, and are trying to
decide if it was arson. Specifically, they are trying to determine the probability
that the fire was deliberately, as opposed to accidentally, set. From a frequentist
standpoint, this question doesn&#8217;t even make sense. The fire is a one-off, and it was
either arson or it wasn&#8217;t. But we can talk about our degree of confidence that it
was arson, or alternatively about how surprised we would be to find that it was
an accident. If the intrepid inspector says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you nineteen to one that it
was arson,&#8221; he&#8217;s implicitly stating that he is extremely (95%) confident in his
conclusion.
<!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >  But how does he get to that conclusion? Let&#8217;s say that the investigators have learned the
following facts (either from a site inspection or just from experience).

      is arson is about 0.10 overall). The inspector knows this, the prior probability,
      even before he arrives at the crime scene.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-71004x2">There were strong signs that this particular fire burned very hot&#8212;hotter than
      one would expect for a typical restaurant fire, but consistent with the use of
      something like thermite to start a fire quickly. In fact, only about 8% of the
      fires in this town burn that hot. This new information will help him determine
      a posterior probability.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-71006x3">About 50% of the arsons in this town use accelerants like thermite. In other

<!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >The investigators can rightly conclude that the witness is helpful, but not overwhelmingly
so. Given the relative rarity of this minority, it is eight times as likely that the witness

conclusive.
<!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >  As we mentioned, one advantage of the Bayesian framework, is that it can be

The posterior probability becomes the prior probability in the next round; we&#8217;ve
updated our estimate from about 1-in-20 to about 1-in-9. We can now continue to
update as the reports trickle in. For example, a study of the scene of the crime
found some bloodstains of a rather unusual type. In particular, this type is rare in
the population at large, but relatively common in the minority. (Genetically, this
isn&#8217;t that uncommon&#8212;Peruvian Indians, for example, have near 100% type O
blood, so if a bloodstain in Lima tests as type B, it&#8217;s probably not from a Peruvian
Indian.)

That&#8217;s probably enough to let the investigators change how they do the investigation. In this

guide the investigation itself more fruitfully.

Perhaps obviously, if you were a military tailor in Scotland, this kind of data could help
inform you as to which sizes to stock. Looking at the histogram, for example, we see that
only a few were scrawny enough to fit into a 33-inch uniform (you will only sell a few of
those). The same holds for the barrel-chested 48-inch uniforms. Your best-selling size will
be the medium-sized 39- or 40-inch.

West Springfield data goes all the way to downright bizarre. And one important
thing that a sociologist would want to know about that income data is why the

in childbirth, or earthquakes. It applies when we have rare and independent events for
which the (low) probability is known, and we wish to count how many events are likely to
occur in a given period of time. For example, the probability of having a baby at any
particular time is small (in this data set, there are fewer than two babies per hour on
average), but some clustering by chance is likely to happen. This is an important model for
understanding questions like &#8220;How many cashiers does a store need to hire to keep
customer wait time at a reasonable level&#8221; (a surprisingly difficult question that is
dealt with in the rarefied mathematical field known as &#8220;queuing theory&#8221;) or to the

distribution is very unusual and often occurs when you are conflating data of
two separate kinds. (For this example, we rolled 30,000 &#8220;fair&#8221; pairs of dice and

and used, as in a college bookstore). In fact, you might even see a &#8220;tetramodal&#8221;
distribution of prices, with new hardcovers, used hardcovers, new paperbacks,
and used paperbacks each contributing their own price peak&#8212;thus showing the
utter futility of making sweeping generalizations about textbook marketing in
general.

 id="x1-750004.2.3"></a>Central Tendency</h4>
<!--l. 495--><p class="noindent" >Since distribution can take on such weird shapes, it&#8217;s often useful and informative to have
numeric descriptions to help in comparing different groups. At least one of these
descriptions you&#8217;re already familiar with: the good, old-fashioned <a 
 id="dx1-75001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">average</span>. We calculate
the &#8220;grade average&#8221; by adding up all of the relevant scores and then dividing by the count
of those scores; the average of 70, 80, and 90 is <img 
src="main151x.png" alt="70+80+90
    3"  class="frac" align="middle">, as we all learned in grade
school.
<!--l. 497--><p class="indent" >  But an &#8220;average&#8221; is really an approximate measure of the center of the distribution of the
grades, and for this reason is called a <a 
 id="dx1-75002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">measure of central tendency</span>. There are actually a
number of such measures, each with slightly different properties. The average we just
defined, for example, is technically called the <a 
 id="dx1-75003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">arithmetic mean</span>. There is also a <a 
 id="dx1-75004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">geometric</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">mean </span>(rarely used, but important for problems involving proportional growth), which we
can determine by multiplying all the data together and then taking the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">N</span>-th root (where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">N </span>is
the number of datapoints).
<!--l. 499--><p class="indent" >  There is also the <a 
 id="dx1-75005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">median </span>and the <a 
 id="dx1-75006"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">mode</span>. The <a 
 id="dx1-75007"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">mode </span>is simply defined as the most
frequently occurring data element. The <a 
 id="dx1-75008"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">median </span>is the value at which half of the sample
scores above and half below. For an example of how these can differ, consider the case
of a limousine containing a wealthy industrialist making $1,000,000/year, her
private secretary making $40,000/year, a driver making $30,000 and two security
guards making $20,000. The mean (average) income of the people in the car is
$<img 
src="main152x.png" alt="1,110,000
---5---"  class="frac" align="middle">, or $370,000, but that hardly seems an accurate way to describe the central
tendency.
<!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >  The modal income is simply the most common salary, the $20,000 that the security
guards make. If you picked one of these people at random and asked how much they make,
that would be the most common&#8212;the &#8220;average&#8221;&#8212;answer. The median income is the
driver&#8217;s $30,000, since two people make more than that and two make less (the driver thus
represents the &#8220;midrange&#8221; of salaries). These three numbers (mean, mode, and median)
are all arguably averages, but they are all different values, and mean different
things.
<!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >  All of this demonstrates that the distribution of incomes in the car is not &#8220;normal&#8221; in the
sense discussed above. The millionaire industrialist is an <a 
 id="dx1-75009"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">outlier</span>; her income is so
far out of the range of the rest that she distorts the overall mean. With normal
distributions, all three averages are the same, but the further things get from normal, the
more they differ. Formally, we can say that the income distribution is <a 
 id="dx1-75010"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">skewed</span><a 
 id="dx1-75011"></a> and
asymmetric, and precisely because of this skewing, the different &#8220;averages&#8221; mean
different things. As you might guess, choosing the measure of central tendency most
likely to get your point across (as opposed to the measure that most accurately
describes the central tendency) represents one of the more damnable ways to lie with
statistics.
<!--l. 505--><p class="indent" >  What is the &#8220;average&#8221; income in your home town? If I want to persuade you of how
wealthy my town is (perhaps I&#8217;m selling real estate), I might want to overstate it. At the
same time, I might want to understate that wealth when I&#8217;m trying to persuade the
government that new taxes will adversely affect our poverty-ridden community. But is the
income &#8220;normally distributed?&#8221; Suppose that in my mostly middle-class town, there&#8217;s one
billionaire. This is a pretty good description of the street in Oxfordshire where
one of the authors once lived. The &#8220;billionaire&#8221; was Richard Branson (of Virgin
Records fame). The median income was probably less than £30,000, but the &#8220;mean&#8221;
income&#8212;because of the influence of the outlier&#8212;might have been ten times that.
Living near Richard Branson will inflate the mean income of the area, but not the
median.

the data for the incomes of thirteen people in a pretty good approximation of a normal
distribution; the modal (most common) value ($30,000) is in the middle of the group, and
the incomes are distributed symmetrically around it. The median income happens at the
exact center of the list (with Ginger) at $30,000, and the total sum of the incomes is
$390,000, yielding a mean income of $30,000. The right side, however, shows the
effect of our outlier. Richard has had a thirteen-million dollar windfall, which
pushes the total income up to $13,270,000 and the mean to just over a million
dollars, despite the fact that only one person in the entire set makes that much.
Can we really have a situation where more than 90% of the population is below

<!--l. 564--><p class="noindent" >The real lesson, of course, is that &#8220;average&#8221; by itself isn&#8217;t all that meaningful. The
notion of skewness has already been introduced as a measure of how asymmetric a
distribution is, and (implicitly) as a measure of how meaningful the &#8220;average&#8221; is as a
single concept. But even in a perfectly symmetric distribution, a well-defined
concept such as the mean still loses information. (One could argue that this is
implicit in the idea of summary statistics; a summary always loses information. But
how does one know what information is being lost, and how meaningful that loss
is?)

<!--l. 591--><p class="indent" >  For normal distributions, there is a well-known relationship between the standard
deviation, the mean, and the probability of a certain degree of difference from the mean.
For example, IQ tests are designed to have a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a
standard deviation of 15. In general, about 69% of the population will be within one
standard deviation of the mean (if the distribution is normal), so we would expect about
15% of the population to have IQs above 115, 15% below 85, and 69% to be in the
range of 85&#8211;115. This relationship only holds, however, when the distribution is
normal. The mean number of legs per person, for example, is just under 2 (reflecting
the fact that some, due to injury or other reason, have one leg). Since the vast
majority of the population has two legs, this means that the vast majority of the
population has more legs than average. But many more people have 1 leg than
3&#x2026;.
<!--l. 594--><p class="indent" >  Our IQ test also allows us to give <a 
 id="dx1-76009"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">percentile </span>ranks: if your IQ is 115, you are at the 85th
percentile of the population. To speak of percentiles is, of course, to indicate that you
have broken up the data into percentages. It is also possible to speak of <a 
 id="dx1-76010"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">quartiles</span>
and (occasionally) <a 
 id="dx1-76011"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">deciles</span>. In each case, we are dividing the <a 
 id="dx1-76012"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">range </span>of values
(the highest value in the set minus the lowest value) into discrete groups (four
groups in the case of quartiles, ten groups in the case of deciles). Such divisions
are often used precisely to exclude outliers. For example, in describing central
tendency in a curve with extreme high or low values, it might make more sense to
compute the measures of central tendency for the <a 
 id="dx1-76013"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">interquartile range </span>(the two
&#8220;inner&#8221; groups of values within a set of data that have been divided into four equal

<!--l. 625--><p class="indent" >  Correlation can be very important for teasing out cause-and-effect relationships in data.
For example, if there is a high correlation between a person&#8217;s graduate education and
income, then we can conclude that the two are related somehow. Either people with a high
income are more likely to be able to afford grad school, or people with graduate degrees
make more, or perhaps a third factor causes both (smart people both go to school and make
more money).
<!--l. 627--><p class="indent" >  Obviously, this must be approached with caution, because we don&#8217;t know just from the
correlation whether money causes schooling, schooling causes money, or whether some
other factor causes both. Still, we can be confident that some relationship exists and we can
use this to help us decide how best to look for it. It is true that some of the most truly
breathtaking pseudoscience has been justified in the name of this caution (the correlation
between smoking and cancer has been known for a long time, but <span

has been very hard to collect). So caution itself must also be approached with
caution. What&#8217;s the alternative idea, that cancer causes people to smoke? While that
may be (barely) supportable mathematically, it lacks a foundation in common
sense.

<!--l. 631--><p class="noindent" >Using mathematics to test whether a plausible idea is likely to be true is one of the most
important uses of statistics, and frankly, one of the hardest to get right. If all of Johnny&#8217;s
previous homeworks scored in the 30s, and then he suddenly scores in the 80s, did he cheat,
or did he just luck out? Probing such questions takes us into the realm of <a

<span

<!--l. 633--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately, statistics alone can&#8217;t answer this question, and indeed understanding what
questions statistics alone can and cannot answer is really at the heart of the problem.
Statistics <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">can </span>tell us the likelihood that Johnny did something different&#8212;whether it be
hiring a tutor, studying harder, or cheating&#8212;or whether Johnny simply got lucky this week
and this is part of a normal variation in his scores. But while statistics may be able to tell
you that blondes make more money on average, they can&#8217;t tell you whether that&#8217;s <span

people pay blondes more, or <span

dye their hair blonde. This sounds like an obvious distinction, but it&#8217;s a subtle
one in practice. Often, it is precisely the cause that we&#8217;re after, and statistical
information can help us toward conclusions about where causes lie. But that is not at
all the same thing as saying that the statistics establish or prove a causal link.
&#8220;Correlation is not causality&#8221; is something like a proverb among people who work
with statistical data. The Roman rhetoricians spoke of it as a particularly vicious
fallacy, naming it <span

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">null</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">hypothesis</span>: the idea that nothing interesting is going on and that only random variation
is occuring. For example, if we are interested in the idea that men have worse
handwriting than women, the corresponding null hypothesis would be that men
and women have, on average, equally bad handwriting. This null hypothesis is
usually referred to as <span

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">experimental hypothesis</span>; in
this case, the idea that men&#8217;s handwriting is worse (or at least different) from
women&#8217;s.
<!--l. 639--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not practical to look directly for evidence that men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s
handwriting differs. This might seem odd, but what happens if you look for evidence and
don&#8217;t find it? Does that mean that there is no evidence, or does it mean that you didn&#8217;t look
hard enough or in the right place? If the differences are real, but subtle, then we don&#8217;t want
to say &#8220;there is no difference&#8221; when all we really know is that we didn&#8217;t find any. So
instead, statisticians approach the problem in reverse, by trying to find evidence that the
null hypothesis is not true.
<!--l. 641--><p class="indent" >  There are, therefore, two possible outcomes of any hypothesis test. One can either <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">reject</span>
the null hypothesis (if we find enough evidence to convince us that it is not true), or else
simply <span

<!--l. 643--><p class="indent" >  The main reason that we do it this way, however, is that for a sensibly chosen null
hypothesis, we can calculate (numerically) how unlikely a given outcome is based on the
typical patterns that we see. For example, it is common knowledge that an average house
cat&#8212;say, a Siamese&#8212;weighs about ten pounds. If you visit someone&#8217;s house and see a
ten-pound cat with Siamese markings, you accept that as consonant with reality. But if
you visit and see a forty-pound monster, even with the Siamese markings, you
would be much more likely to reject the idea that this is an ordinary Siamese, in
favor of the idea that it was some sort of unusual breed that also had colorpoint
markings.
<!--l. 645--><p class="indent" >  Where, though, do you draw the line? Would you reject a thirty-pound monster?
Twenty-five? Fifteen? This is where the statistics come in. Consider the (completely
fictitious) data given in table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-790046">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: table:catweights --></a>. Out of 100 Siamese cats measured, 50 weigh
at least 10 pounds. Generalizing this to the population at large, it implies that
if you pick up a cat at random, it has a 50/50 chance of weighing at least ten
pounds. Only 15 cats weighed more than 20 pounds, so a random Siamese would be
expected to have about a 15% chance (<span

Only 7 cats weighed 25 pounds or more, and no cat measured weighed forty or

<!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" >If the probability that we get our observed data given the null hypothesis (i.e., the
likelihood of a normal Siamese being that heavy) is lower than some threshold,
we reject the null hypothesis as being incompatible with our observations. We
could say, for example, that if the chance of something happening is less than
5% (thus setting the threshold to 5%), we reject it. In this case, we would accept
the idea of a twenty-five pound Siamese, but reject the idea of a thirty-pound
one.
<!--l. 668--><p class="indent" >  Choosing the threshold can be tricky, because there are two potential errors that need to
be balanced against each other. On the one hand, you could overzealously reject the null
hypothesis when it happens to be true (in which case, Fluffy really needs to go on a diet!).
On the other hand, you could naively accept the null hypothesis (&#8220;How dare you think that I
would let my cat get that unhealthily obese! She&#8217;s not a Siamese, she&#8217;s half Maine Coon.&#8221;).
In either case, there are possible negative consequences&#8212;either you are putting the cat&#8217;s
health at risk, or you risk insulting a friend. Which is a more important error for you to
avoid?
<!--l. 670--><p class="indent" >  Our example is a bit fanciful, but serious examples abound. If the numbers for a
particular disease (say, tuberculosis or influenza) are up from last year, that might just
be ordinary year-to-year variation. It might, however, indicate the emergence
of a new strain, and thus be the leading edge of a major health emergency.
Ignoring a genuine problem might put much of the population at risk, but taking
unneeded drastic measures will cost time, money, and might cause panic and
other social problems (along with the loss of confidence when it turns out to be

unneeded).<span class="footnote-mark"><a

consequences of one type of error are significantly worse than another type (William
Blackstone famously thought that &#8220;it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to let one

only do that by gathering more data, which may be difficult or impossible. Finally,
depending upon what else you know about the data (or are willing to assume that you
know), it may be possible to perform more accurate tests, as we will see in the following
sections.
<!--l. 678--><p class="indent" >  An easy way to test the hypothesis that there is some relationship between
handwriting and gender would be to gather a pool of people, say a first-year college

looks like a prescription pad). Our experimental hypothesis is that men will be

 id="x1-810004.3.3"></a>Parametric Tests</h4>
<!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" >There are two general types of statistical tests: <a 
 id="dx1-81001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">parametric tests </span>and <a 
 id="dx1-81002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">nonparametric tests</span>.
Parametric tests are those that make assumptions about the underlying shape of the data.
For example, a normal (bell) curve is symmetric&#8212;indicating, for example, that there are as
many people 50% above the average as there are 50% below the average. If your
experimental data is bell-shaped, you can carry this theoretical assumption out into the real
world. But in many cases, the data will not be symmetrical, and you will make
an error if you assume such a high degree of symmetry. The average weight of
a cat may be ten pounds, but there are more cats that weigh 25 pounds, fifteen
pounds above the average, than weigh -5 pounds, fifteen pounds below. Despite
these limitations, parametric tests are probably the most commonly used tests,
because the assumptions are generally easy to conceive, and are often met in the real
world.
<!--l. 712--><p class="indent" >  Tests can be further subdivided by the type of question they purport to answer. For
example, &#8220;Is this (individual) cat too heavy to be a Siamese?&#8221; is a question of whether a
single data point is likely to have come from a known data set. &#8220;Is men&#8217;s handwriting less
legible on average than women&#8217;s?&#8221; is a question about whether two different data sets have
the same mean. &#8220;Do intelligent people have larger brains?&#8221; is a question about the
relationship between two distributions, in effect asking whether cases that are high on one
scale (tested intelligence) are also likely to score highly on another scale (brain
volume).
<!--l. 714--><p class="indent" >  Space prevents us from giving detailed descriptions of all of the tests that have been
proposed, but we will try to explain enough that you can understand some of the major
ones. The most important thing is to try to understand the assumptions that underlie the
tests, because those are what determine whether the use of a particular test in a particular
case is justified.
<!--l. 717--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-820004.3.3"></a>Comparing a Data Point to a Group with Known Characteristics.</h5>
<!--l. 719--><p class="noindent" >This simplest of all statistical tests is designed to determine how likely an individual is
to have come from a known population (as with our forty-pound monster cat
above). In this case, if the population is known to have a normal distribution, with a
known mean and standard deviation, we can simply calculate how far (in terms of
standard deviations) the data point is from the mean. If our cats have, for instance, a
mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 5, a twenty-pound cat is two standard
deviations above the norm. A forty-pound cat is six standard deviations above the
norm.
<!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >  The relevant probability can be read directly from the charts describing the standard
normal distribution. For example, approximately 14% of the population will be one or more
standard deviations above the norm. Only 2.2% will be two or more standard deviations
above the norm. Less than one half of 1% of the population will be three or more standard
deviations above the norm.
<!--l. 727--><p class="indent" >  For historical reasons, the standard normal distribution is sometimes called the
<a 
 id="dx1-82001"></a><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">-distribution, </span>and for this reason, this test is called the <a 
 id="dx1-82002"></a><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">-test. </span>As a parametric test, it is
only appropriate when the specific assumptions are legitimate. So in this case, to use a
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span>-test, we need to know (or assume) that the population at large follows a normal
distribution, that we know the mean and the standard deviations for the population at large
(not just for our sample), that the sample is big enough (thirty to fifty data points is a good
rule of thumb), and that the population at large is sufficiently larger than the sample (5 or
10 times larger, at least).
<!--l. 729--><p class="indent" >  When the conditions are met, this kind of test can also be used to compare a single data
point to several groups, in an effort to classify it (to determine into which group it should
be placed). For example, if you would expect 8% of group A to score at your
data point, but only 0.1% of group B to score that extremely, then you can say
with relative confidence that your data point is more likely to come from group
A.
<!--l. 731--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-830004.3.3"></a>Comparing a Group to Another of Known Characteristics</h5>
<!--l. 733--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span>-test can also be used to compare one group against another group whose descriptive
statistics are known exactly. For example, we mentioned earlier that IQ tests are designed to
have results that are normally distributed, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of
15. To test whether college students have higher IQs than the population at large, you could
simply get a large enough and representative enough sample of college students, give
them IQ tests, and then use a <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">z</span>-test to see how far from 100 the sample average
is.
<!--l. 735--><p class="noindent" >
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-840004.3.3"></a>Comparing Two Groups</h5>
<!--l. 737--><p class="noindent" >The next simplest type of test is the one where you compare two groups. You can either do
this directly (is experimental group A different from experimental group B?), or you can
compare one group against a &#8220;known&#8221; background (is experimental group A different from
the general population whose characteristics I can look up?). This is slightly more difficult
than the preceding case because you have an additional source of error to contend with; the
data of your group(s) are almost certainly not exactly what the &#8220;true&#8221; average should be, for
the same reason that if you flip fifty coins, you&#8217;re not likely to get exactly twenty-five
heads.
<!--l. 739--><p class="indent" >  For example,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main40.html#fn9x4"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-84001f9"></a>
one researcher used a standard psychological test (the Rosenberg test of self-esteem) to
measure the self-esteem of a group of 112 Wellesley undergraduates. The published norms
for this test state that the average score for the general public is 3.9. The Wellesley
undergraduates scored an average of 4.04&#8212;slightly above average&#8212;but with a
group standard deviation of 0.6542, reflecting the fact that individual scores can,
and do, vary all over the map. The question was then posed whether these data
show that Wellesley students actually have a higher average self-esteem than
the population at large. A related but different example would arise if the same
researcher had given a self-esteem test to a group of Harvard undergraduates
as well, gotten a separate mean (and standard deviation) for Harvard, and then
asked whether Harvard students really differed from Wellesley students in their
self-esteem.
<!--l. 741--><p class="indent" >  The most common parametric test for this situation is the <a 
 id="dx1-84002"></a><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">-test, </span>which comes in a variety
of subtypes (such as paired <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-tests or pooled <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-tests). This test is appropriate when all
groups involved are normally distributed and the individual sample standard deviations are
known, but the deviations of the population-at-large is not. (This is probably the most
common situation one encounters, which is why the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test is so widely used). When these
assumptions are met, one can calculate from the means, the standard deviations, and the
size of each group a probability that both groups were &#8220;really&#8221; drawn from the same
underlying group (more technically, from groups with the same underlying mean, since
Harvard students are obviously a different group of people than Wellesley students). In
other words, we can assess the likelihood that Wellesley students, Harvard students,
and the public at large are alike with regard to their (mean) self-esteem. If this
probability is low enough, the null hypothesis will be rejected (as in the study
cited).
<!--l. 743--><p class="indent" >  So what&#8217;s the difference between this study and the IQ study in the previous paragraph?
With the IQ study, we know the mean and the standard deviation of the general
population&#8212;not only what the average score is, but also how individual people or small
groups are expected to vary from the average. With the self-esteem study, we know the
average, but not the variation around the average. We therefore need to estimate this
variation, which is built into the calculations for the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test.
  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-850004.3.3"></a>Comparing Three or More Groups</h5>
<!--l. 747--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test is not appropriate when one is comparing three or more groups simultaneously.
For example, if you wanted to know whether all college students in the Boston area had the
same self-esteem, you could gather groups from Harvard, MIT, Wellesley, BU, BC,
Northeastern, Tufts, and UMass. This group of eight schools would yield 28 separate
pairings between schools that you could test using <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-tests. However, this would
raise the chance of a false rejection error to an unacceptably high level (almost
to the level of a dead certainty, in fact). (Remember that each test has its own
chance of a false-rejection error, typically set at 0.05 or one in twenty; taking
twenty-eight shots at a basketball hoop at one chance in twenty makes it very likely to
hit.)
<!--l. 749--><p class="indent" >  Instead, we want to compare all the groups at once. The appropriate parametric test to
use in this instance is the <a 
 id="dx1-85001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">ANOVA </span>(short for &#8220;analysis of variance&#8221;) test, which is
essentially a generalization of the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test that controls for the multiple shots at the target
problem. Again, this is a parametric test, and only useful when the underlying groups are
normally distributed. Furthermore, the variance must be the same across groups. Like the
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test, there are several different types of ANOVA depending upon the exact question you
are asking.

<!--l. 753--><p class="noindent" >The measurements of association discussed in section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-770004.2.5">4.2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:association --></a> give direct rise to a test for
association. If you want to know, for example, if there is a relationship between brain size
and intelligence, measure both and determine what the association is. The standard
methods for measuring correlations (Pearson&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">) </span>can be turned directly into a
probability measure when the size of the samples are known (and such tables are
widely available). The same cautions apply to this test as to any others, though.
Pearson&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r </span>describes only how well the data can be fit to a straight line; data
that fits perfectly to a curved line may have a low straight-line correlation when
measured.
<!--l. 755--><p class="indent" >  More technically, the calculations of Pearson&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r </span>make some assumptions about the
underlying data. In particular, it assumes that the &#8220;residuals&#8221; (how far each point is from
the regression line) are normally distributed, and that the variability of the residuals
are the same regardless of the size of the individual data points. In some cases,
these assumptions are clearly false. For example, there is a clear relationship
between age and height among children, but the variability in height is much
greater for older children than for younger ones. (A three year old who is a foot
taller than average is a giant. A fourteen year old who is a foot taller than average
is merely a basketball player.) If these assumptions are not met, then <span

<!--l. 757--><p class="indent" >  To return to the handwriting legibility study: We are comparing two groups, so a <span

(or might be) appropriate. Running that test, we get a <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">p</span>-value of about 0.42, meaning that
even if men and women were exactly the same in terms of average legibility, we&#8217;d see that
big a difference more than 40% of the time. Based on this, we &#8220;fail to reject the null
hypothesis&#8221; and we conclude that we have no reason to believe that men and women differ
in handwriting legibility.

<!--l. 762--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps it is a good time for us to mention that few people do any of these calculations by
hand. In many cases, the mathematics is easy enough, but rather tedious to compute
manually (ANOVA, in particular, involves some quite involved calculations).
For this reason, we (and nearly everyone else who works with statistical data)
use statistical software packages to analyze data. There are many such packages
available,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main41.html#fn10x4"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-87001f10"></a>
and all of them are capable not only of conducting nearly any conceivable statistical test,
but have facilities for manipulating all manner of data and generating plots and
graphs that take advantage of established techniques in data visualization. Even
ordinary spreadsheet software usually comes with a vast battery of statistical
functions.
<!--l. 764--><p class="indent" >  Often, these packages allow you to pull <span

a command. The important thing, of course, is to know whether the test is appropriate or
not. We have both seen research results that seemed to us to be sustained mainly by
overeager (and ill-informed) exploitation of the capabilities of the software. On the other
hand, neither of us would consent to analyze data without such programs, and you can
usually be confident that the implementation of the tests and analysis routines have been
pored over and tested for accuracy.
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.4</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-880004.3.4"></a>Non-parametric Tests</h4>
<!--l. 768--><p class="noindent" >So what do we do when we meet dragons (situations in which we cannot make
assumptions about the underlying shape of the data)? The simplest answer is
just to cross our fingers and use the parametric tests anyway; in many cases, the
assumptions, while formally necessary, can be violated without damaging the
accuracy of the test or the inferences drawn from it. Looking at the sensitivity of
various standard tests to different kinds of assumption-violations is a substantial
research area in modern statistics. In particular, the aforementioned Central Limit
Theorem states that if you sample often enough from an oddly-shaped distribution,
the sum (or the average) of your samples will be normally distributed. In many
cases, this means that if you simply have enough data&#8212;some have proposed, as a
general rule of thumb, two dozen or so data points&#8211;it&#8217;s safe to use parametric
tests.
<!--l. 770--><p class="indent" >  But what if you don&#8217;t have enough data? In such cases, statisticians have proposed
<a 
 id="dx1-88001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">non-parametric tests</span>: tests that do not make assumptions about the underlying
distribution. Each of the standard tests discussed above has one or several nonparametric
equivalents. For example, instead of using the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test, you can use the <a 
 id="dx1-88002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Wilcoxon</span>
test or <a 
 id="dx1-88003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mann-Whitney </span>test. Instead of the ANOVA, use the <a 
 id="dx1-88004"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Kruskal-Wallis </span>or
<a 
 id="dx1-88005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Friedman </span>test. For Pearson&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r</span>, use <a 
 id="dx1-88006"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Spearman&#8217;s </span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03C1;</span>. The details of these can be
found in any statistics text, and once again, the statistics packages know all about
them.
<!--l. 772--><p class="indent" >  The main problem with nonparametric tests is that they tend to be weaker (in the sense of
beta cutoffs) than their parametric cousins. For example, the Wilcoxon test will sometimes
fail to reject the null hypothesis where a standard <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test would reject it on the same
(valid) dataset. The only way to address this is to provide more data, and studies
suggest that a <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test only needs about 95% of the data that a Wilcoxon test needs, or,
alternatively, that a Wilcoxon test can only pull 95% of the information out of the
data that the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>-test can. Similarly, Spearman&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03C1; </span>has about 91% of the power of
Pearson&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r</span>, which means that if you need 100 data points to find an effect using
Spearman&#8217;s test, you would only need 91 to use Pearson&#8217;s test (assuming it&#8217;s
appropriate).
<!--l. 777--><p class="indent" >  What kind of test should you use? There are really four cases. Either you have lots and
lots of data&#8212;enough to overcome the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis
when the null hypothesis is actually false&#8212;or you don&#8217;t, and you need to be cautious.
Likewise, you either have data that fits a nice &#8220;normal&#8221; shape, or you don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;ve got
lots of normally-distributed data, then a parametric test is appropriate and more
efficient than a nonparametric one, but 91% or 95% of lots of information is still
lots of information. If you have lots of non-normal data, then the Central Limit
Theorem tells us that it&#8217;s probably safe to use the parametric test anyway. So
in either case, the problems caused by using the wrong type of test are not that
serious.
<!--l. 779--><p class="indent" >  It&#8217;s when you get into small data sets that the problems arise. Using a non-parametric test
on normally-distributed data will lose power and efficiency, costing information that you
probably didn&#8217;t want to lose. The calculated probability values are likely to be high, and so
you are more likely to make a false acceptance of the null hypothesis. If you use a
parametric test inappropriately on small data, the results could be almost anything. The
probability value is likely to be inaccurate&#8212;and you wouldn&#8217;t even know whether it&#8217;s more
likely to be overstated or understated.
<!--l. 781--><p class="indent" >  So how does one avoid these problems? There are two ways. The first is
simply to double up&#8212;to run non-parametric tests in conjunction with any
parametric tests, and look for differences (a matter made trivial by computer
software).<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main42.html#fn11x4"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-88007f11"></a>
The second is to examine the data themselves prior to analysis, to see if the data are
actually distributed normally. This can be done easily just by eyeballing it. For example,
here is the distribution of the data for men&#8217;s handwriting legibility (presented earlier as

<!--l. 802--><p class="noindent" >As we have seen, the interpretation of test results can be tricky. Superficially, one ordinarily
compares the observed probability value to the previously decided alpha cutoff, and decides
whether to reject the null hypothesis.
<!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >  But what does this mean, exactly? If the null hypothesis is rejected, then we conclude
that the experimental hypothesis is true. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then we
conclude that there is not enough evidence in this test to decide one way or another. Notice
that in this framework, we can never conclude that the experimental hypothesis is false.
This is one of the meanings of the oft-cited maxim that &#8220;you can&#8217;t prove a negative.&#8221; Of
course, you <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">can </span>prove a negative. Neither of us have tigers in our refrigerators; we just
checked. You can&#8217;t, however, prove a negative <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">by statistical analysis. </span>I can&#8217;t prove, for
example, that drinking grape Kool-Aid will not cure cancer. It might have some effect that&#8217;s
too small for me to have seen in the experiments I did. Maybe if I had studied fifty
thousand people instead of fifty, something would have shown up. Maybe if I had run
my unicorn detectors for a hundred years instead of a week, I would have found
one.
<!--l. 806--><p class="indent" >  Or not. But you can&#8217;t use statistics to prove I wouldn&#8217;t have.
<!--l. 808--><p class="indent" >  Interpretation of the probability values is an issue as well. Technically speaking, if we
reject the null hypothesis (say we got a probability value of 0.02, and we used an alpha
cutoff of 0.05), we still run the risk of making a mistake. No statistical conclusions can be
drawn with 100% confidence. But does this mean that (since we got a 0.02), that our
conclusion is 98% likely to be true?
<!--l. 810--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately not. What if these are the results coming out of our unicorn detector? Our
value only says that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">if  </span>the null hypothesis were true, then there would be only a probability
of 0.02 (2%) of getting the results we did. But if we run our unicorn detector a hundred
times, we would have expected to see such a result twice. Knowing as you do that unicorns
don&#8217;t exist (sorry, Steve), you will have no problem concluding that we just got
lucky&#8212;or unlucky, depending upon your point of view. There&#8217;s still a 0% chance that
we detected a unicorn, and a 100% chance that something unlikely happened to
happen.
<!--l. 812--><p class="indent" >  This is the final point in interpreting test results and statistics, and we hope you&#8217;ll pardon
us for stating the obvious: Use common sense. Spurious findings can and do occur (indeed,
if you do twenty experiments, the odds are in favor of you finding at least one spurious
result at the 0.05 level). If a result is simply nonsensical, then treat it with appropriate
caution. As an illustration of this, we would like to share a true, genuine story of an
actual event, with only a few details changed to minimize the embarrassment of all
concerned.
<!--l. 814--><p class="indent" >  At a conference in Scandinavia years ago, a European researcher was presenting a paper
on some sort of social behavior: let&#8217;s say it was the distribution of drink purchases
at a German bar, or the distribution of glottal stops in Czech place names, or
something like that. The researcher&#8217;s conclusion, proudly trumpeted through the
medium of PowerPoint, was that the distribution was best described by a &#8220;confluent
hypergeometric distribution.&#8221; At this point, the person sitting next to Patrick, a
very gifted lecturer in statistics at a major British university, leaned over and
whispered in his ear, &#8220;Now, there&#8217;s a man with a statistics program too powerful for
him.&#8221;
<!--l. 816--><p class="indent" >  Why did she (the statistics professor) think that? Well, the results violated common
sense. Don&#8217;t worry about not knowing the meaning of a &#8220;confluent hypergeometic
distribution.&#8221; No one does&#8212;not even the statistics Ph.D.&#8217;s that we&#8217;ve asked about it. Some
of them&#8212;a relative few&#8212; do know what a &#8220;hypergeometric distribution&#8221; is; it&#8217;s a special
kind of non-normal distribution that you see about once a decade, under very restrictive
circumstances. It&#8217;s related to the idea of product testing (the number of &#8220;successes&#8221;
(products that aren&#8217;t broken) that you get when you take products in succession out of a
box without putting them back after testing.
<!--l. 818--><p class="indent" >  The key insight here is that this has nothing to do with either drink ordering or
glottal stops; in particular, the key aspect &#8220;without putting them back&#8221; means that
once you&#8217;ve tested a particular widget, it&#8217;s no longer available to be tested. (The
technical term for this is &#8220;without replacement.&#8221;) But, of course, if I decide to
pronounce my village name with a glottal stop, that doesn&#8217;t make glottal stops
unavailable. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a world supply of glottal stops that will be exhausted.
And although there is a world supply of whisky, it&#8217;s not going to be exhausted in
a single night in a single bar. The underlying assumptions that give rise to the
hypergeometric distribution simply don&#8217;t fit the environment in which the researcher was
working.
<!--l. 820--><p class="indent" >  On the other hand, a test for a confluent hypergeometric distribution&#8212;a parametric test
with very strong assumptions built in&#8212;is apparently distributed as part of one major

apparently gone one-by-one through all the tests in the drop-down menus looking for the
one with the smallest <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">p</span>-value. If there are fifty tests in the package, he was almost
certain to find one he liked. He triumphantly dragged it out, without thinking about
whether it made sense, or if it was really true. To the amusement of the professional
statisticians in the audience, it almost certainly wasn&#8217;t. In a sense, he was lying
to himself, at least by omission, by not checking to see whether his story was
plausible.

any sort of robust scholarly debate, one has to ask&#8212;how do you know this? And what does
it mean? And, in particular, does Hemingway actually use &#8220;short&#8221; sentences relative to
other writers?
<!--l. 828--><p class="indent" >  The statistics, if you let the texts themselves narrate, tell a different story. The average
sentence length in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The Sun Also Rises </span>is about 20.4 words. By contrast, the average
sentence length of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The Great Gatsby </span>is 14.0, or in other words (in this sample),
Hemingway writes sentences about half again <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">longer </span>than Fitzgerald. Amazon.com
computes these figures for you, if you care, in the &#8220;Text Stats&#8221; sections of the web
pages&#8212;a feature to which the authors find themselves entirely addicted. Perhaps more
importantly, of the books which Amazon has studied, an astonishing 73% have a shorter
sentence length. (This isn&#8217;t an isolated finding. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The Old Man and the Sea </span>has an
average sentence length of 16.0, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">For Whom The Bell Tolls </span>has 21.1.) The
statistics tell a story of Hemingway, in fact, using sentences substantially longer than
average.
<!--l. 830--><p class="indent" >  Does this invalidate our intuitions that Hemingway &#8220;seems&#8221; terse, choppy,
and simple? Of course not. But it does suggest that the apparent terseness comes
from something other than just &#8220;short sentences.&#8221; Instead of seeing this as a way
of ending debate, we&#8217;d rather see it as opening the door to further discussion.
If it&#8217;s not short sentences, then what is it? How do we account for the variance
between our impressions of the author&#8217;s style and the empirical features of that
style?

<!--l. 838--><p class="indent" >  Mosteller and Wallace observed, in these authors&#8217; other writings, that they differed
substantially in how they used various words, notably prepositions and conjunctions. For
example, the following table looks at forty-eight Hamliton and fifty Madison papers and

and Madison:

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.5</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-930004.5"></a>Lying: a How-To Guide</h3>
<!--l. 889--><p class="noindent" >Despite the strength of this kind of analysis, there&#8217;s still ultimately a strong
reason why people distrust statistics: It&#8217;s too easy to lie, and often too hard to

catch.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="main46.html#fn15x4"><sup class="textsuperscript">15</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-93001f15"></a>
One can lie by omission, simply by making mistakes or by not understanding, or one can
lie more actively&#8212;but in either case, the result is less than illuminating.
<!--l. 891--><p class="indent" >  The simplest type of lie is the simple mistake, using the wrong test or the wrong
formula, or even making a mathematical error (though professional-grade statistics
software makes that extremely unlikely). If you want to make your figures look
good, just run through every test your software has to offer, and then tell your
colleagues about the best results, making sure to pronounce the buzz-words clearly and
confidently. More subtly, you can just confuse the mean, the median, and the mode;
after all, the median income and the mean income in the millionaire&#8217;s car are
substantially different, but if you call them both &#8220;average,&#8221; who will know which you
meant?
<!--l. 893--><p class="indent" >  If you&#8217;re feeling assertive, you can simply force a false interpretation on your audience.
If your <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03B1; </span>cutoff is 0.01, and you reject the null hypothesis, then that means that the chance
of your experimental data having come about by chance is less than 1%. But why not
simply tell them that your experimental hypothesis is 99% likely to be true? Sure, it&#8217;s a lie,
but it&#8217;s much easier to understand, isn&#8217;t it? Studies involving correlation are good
candidates for this kind of forced interpretation; a correlation really says only that there is a
relationship between the two groups studied. But it&#8217;s easy enough to lie and claim you
know what kind of relationship it is. If aspirin consumption is correlated with migraine
headaches, then tell your audience that aspirin is dangerous because it causes migraines
(and collect your pay from the anti-aspirin lobby). An observer paying close attention
might realize that people who have migraines are more likely to take aspirin, so the causal
link is likely to go the other way&#x2026;but as long as you talk fast enough maybe the
audience at large won&#8217;t notice. It&#8217;s true that, as the saying goes, &#8220;correlation (or
association) does not imply causation,&#8221; but you don&#8217;t have to tell your audience
that.
<!--l. 895--><p class="indent" >  Similarly, you can leave out information. Telling us about the mean without telling us
about the variation around the mean is a good way of leaving stuff out. For example, if you
tell us that the average number of wheels per vehicle in a parking garage is 3.0, that
conjures up visions of a building full of bizarre-looking tricycles. Telling us that half have
two and half have four informs me more honestly that a lot of the clients are into
bikes.
<!--l. 897--><p class="indent" >  A more serious way to leave out information is to distort it as it goes in, through selective
reporting. A statistic is only as good as the data it&#8217;s based on, and if you manage to avoid
finding information that goes against your viewpoint, you don&#8217;t have to use it. Darrell Huff
has a great example in his book <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">How to Lie with Statistics </span>(Norton, 1954) about a
report on the incomes of Yale graduates, collected by a survey twenty-five years
after graduation&#8212;a survey, of course, of all the graduates whose incomes were
known and who were willing to respond. Let&#8217;s look at how this introduces two
lies.
<!--l. 899--><p class="indent" >  First, who are the people whose addresses we will know? Or to turn it around, who won&#8217;t
we be able to find? Certainly, we&#8217;ll know where all the congressmen, the federal judges,
and the ambassadors are. The ones we won&#8217;t know will be the &#8220;unsuccessful&#8221; ones: the
bartenders, taxi drivers, the unemployed, and anyone else who might look bad in the
survey. Naturally, we don&#8217;t want to include them&#8212;and we have a perfect excuse not
to.
<!--l. 901--><p class="indent" >  Secondly, what will people say when they respond? Will I respond honestly,
or will I be tempted to shade the truth? And if so, will I want to make myself
look good by raising my actual salary, or look bad by downplaying it? So again,
we&#8217;ve provided an easy way to make sure that the data that comes in is &#8220;better
than life.&#8221; Naturally, this will make our survey data look much, much better for
Yale.
<!--l. 903--><p class="indent" >  This kind of data distortion is, as we all know, called &#8220;<a 
 id="dx1-93002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">bias</span>,&#8221; and it&#8217;s probably the most
common way that people shade their statistics. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no real way to correct
for it once the data has been collected and accepted; statistical techniques can
analyze what you tell them, but they can&#8217;t analyze what you carefully don&#8217;t tell
them.
<!--l. 905--><p class="indent" >  A related problem is that of <a 
 id="dx1-93003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">representativeness</span>. A good way to lie is to measure
something slightly different, but not different enough that the person notices what you did
wrong. For example, we proposed earlier to study self-esteem among Boston-area college
students by surveys at eight good, academically-oriented schools. But how well would the
results transfer to other schools (either less competitive &#8220;second-tier&#8221; schools, or &#8220;art&#8221;
schools such as Berklee College of Music, Longy, or MassArt)? Can we conclude anything
about them? Bias introduced by unrepresentative data can be a real problem in psychology,
because most psychology studies are done on students at the researcher&#8217;s college. But are
university students really representative of the general public? By and large, they are
younger and of higher socioeconomic status. Perhaps they are different in other
ways as well&#8212;and without testing the population at large, we have no way of
knowing.
<!--l. 907--><p class="indent" >  In this chapter we&#8217;ve tried to provide some armor against &#8220;lies, damned lies, and
statistics,&#8221; but we will continue to insist that the most important aspect of this is simply
knowing which tests are appropriate in which circumstances and what the underlying
concepts are. One doesn&#8217;t need to know what a hypergeometric distribution is, or exactly
how to calculate an ANOVA (though both matters can be illuminating for other
reasons). One needs to know, instead, that the ANOVA is being properly applied
(i.e. that the underlying data is the sort of thing we would expect to be normally
distributed with common variance) and that a hypergeometric distribution isn&#8217;t just a
collection of buzzwords. One needs to know that a probability of 0.05 means &#8220;one
time out of 20&#8221; or &#8220;nineteen to one against&#8221;&#8212;an event that is improbable but not
unheard-of.
<!--l. 909--><p class="indent" >  In the end, the damn lies of statistics are a lot like the damn lies of that other tool
of great power known as rhetoric. And that is because statistics is ultimately a
form of rhetoric. Whatever else we might do with statistics, we are always out to
persuade others (or maybe just ourselves) that things are thus and so&#8212;usually as a
way to change minds, and often as a way to inspire actions and inform decisions.
Given that august role, it is perhaps more sensible that Socrates be executed for
having made &#8220;the lesser argument seem the greater&#8221; that that we dismiss the whole
matter as empty and insubstantial (&#8220;just rhetoric,&#8221; &#8220;more damn lies&#8221;). There are
truths, powerful truths, and &#8220;Aha&#8221; moments that only come when we run the
numbers.



  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">5</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-940005"></a>Analysis and Calculus</h2>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >It is customary to portray calculus as a subject poorly taught, and to begin any discussion of
it by inveighing against any number of failings on the part of teachers, students, textbook
authors, and indeed, the entire edifice of mathematics education. But having now attempted
to write a conceptual introduction to calculus, we find ourselves having great sympathy for
anyone who would try to explain it. The problem, we think, has less to do with the
difficulties of the subject itself, and more to do with a tension, which, though appearing in
some potential form in most mathematical subjects, becomes particularly acute with
calculus.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  A &#8220;calculus&#8221; is a method or system of reasoning. So really, we&#8217;ve been putting forth
various &#8220;calculi&#8221; right from the start. If the system we now propose to unfold has earned
the right to be called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the </span>calculus, it&#8217;s because it is one of the most eminently
practical systems ever created for solving a truly vast set of problems. Calculus is, in
this sense, the ultimate form of applied mathematics. We can think of very few
general problems involving numbers that don&#8217;t eventually wend their way around
to the techniques of calculus&#8212;including most of the mathematics of interest to
humanists.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  But there&#8217;s something else about calculus&#8212;something quite beyond any discussion
involving the trajectory of rockets or the dynamics of population change&#8212;that
endears mathematicians to this subject. Because at base, the problems calculus
was designed to solve are full of riddles and paradoxes that take us deep into the
nature of things like numbers, change, infinity, and time. In this sense, it is the
ultimate form of pure mathematics. We can think of very few conceptual problems
involving numbers that don&#8217;t eventually wend their way around to the philosophical
conundrums that gave rise the invention of the calculus, and which continue to inform its
theoretical basis. It is, to put it plainly, one of the most elegant ideas in the history of
thought.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  The tension, then, is between practicality and theoretical musing: between solving
problems and understanding the problem. Focus too much on the former, and the inner
beauty of the thing is lost; focus too much on the latter, and the startling utility of the
techniques is obscured. What&#8217;s more, there are several different ways of thinking about the
subject within this tension: engineers think about it differently from mathematicians, as
physicists tend to think about it differently from statisticians. And we too have our own
way of thinking about it. We are very pleased to be released from the impossible task of
trying to negotiate this territory for a general course that might include all these
constituencies, and entirely humbled by the efforts of those who do precisely
that.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Our method will be to get at the concepts of calculus through the back door (in a way
entirely innappropriate for an ordinary textbook) by speaking first about the loftier matters
upon which its utility rests, and only then turning to the techniques that unfold from that
musing. Our hope is to get at the Big Idea that is set in motion whenever the techniques of
calculus are used.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  Because the Ideas are very Big indeed.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The problem of change&#8212;how to describe it and predict its patterns&#8212;is, at root, a
philosophical problem. Zeno of Elea (c. 490&#8211;c. 430 BCE), whose famous paradoxes are
familiar even to grade school children, was among the first to give us a sense
of the troubling complexities involved. One of his paradoxes, which appears in
Aristotle&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Physics, </span>states, &#8220;[T]hat which is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way
stage before it arrives at the goal&#8221; (VI:9,239b10). That is, if you are standing
on one side of a room, and you want to get to the other side, you must perforce
pass the halfway point between where you are and where you want to go. But
there is, of course, a halfway point between <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">that </span>halfway point and where you
stand. And there&#8217;s another between those two points. Follow this through, and
you may end up concluding that you can&#8217;t get there. In fact, it would seem that
you can&#8217;t move at all, because when we express the halfway points as a series
of fractions, we see that you must pass through an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">infinite </span>number of halfway
points:

<!--l. 25--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  The missing ingredient, here, is time&#8212;a fact intuited by Aristotle, and worked out more
fully in a blaze of insight by Archimedes (c. 287&#8211;c. 212 BCE). For it is obvious that while
the halved distances are becoming infinitely smaller, the time taken to traverse them is also
becoming infinitely minute. Or rather, it is not in the least bit obvious. Nearly two
millenia would pass before anyone would truly feel that they had resolved the
paradox, because a complete mathematical proof (of your reaching the other wall) is
impossible without the contributions made by calculus to the understanding of
infinity.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >  So before we plumb the depths of that understanding, we&#8217;d like to ensure that you are
properly confused about infinity. That way, you&#8217;ll be as baffled by the subject as
mathematicians were prior to Newton, and therefore more likely to appreciate what he
managed to do with his summer vacation in 1667.

<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >What is the area of a circle?
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  Well, it&#8217;s <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03C0;r</span><sup><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span></sup>, from secondary-school geometry. <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">r </span>is the radius of the circle and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03C0; </span>is that
irritating number 3.14159&#x2026;that never ends (the computers, you may recall, blow up when
Captain Kirk asks them for the final digit). And it&#8217;s not really <img 
src="main162x.png" alt="272"  class="frac" align="middle">, though that&#8217;s a good
guess. Eudoxos of Cnidus (c. 408&#8211;c. 347 BCE) is usually credited with that guess, and his
method for arriving at it was, to the say the least, ingenious. It was also deeply
unsatisfying.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  The Greeks, whose mathematics mostly dwelt on problems in geometry, knew how to
find the areas of polygons. They knew that the area of a square, for example, is the length of
the side times itself. They also knew that the area of a triangle is one-half times
the base times the height, so that an equilateral triangle is <img 
src="main163x.png" alt="s2&#x22C5;&#x221A;3-
  4"  class="frac" align="middle">, where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">s </span>is the
length of the side. You probably don&#8217;t remember the formula for the area of a
regular pentagon. We don&#8217;t remember it either, but the Greeks knew that one as
well.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  There&#8217;s a big difference between these areas, though, and the area of a circle. A polygon
has a few, straight sides, while a circle has a single, curved, side. Eudoxus&#8217; great insight
was to use what he understood about polygons to get at the problem of things
that didn&#8217;t have any gons (the word &#8220;polygon&#8221; is a Greek neologism that means
&#8220;many-angled.&#8221;)

href="#x1-960011">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:exhaustion --></a>. We&#8217;ve taken a circle and inscribed a number
of polygons in it. Since the polygons are entirely inside the circle, the area of
each individual polygon will be less than the area of the circle. But as we add
more and more sides to the polygon, it appears that the polygon becomes closer
and closer to the circle. Intuitively, we can suppose that as the number of sides
gets larger and larger, we get a better and better approximation of the area of the
circle.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >  The Greeks called this kind of analysis the <a 
 id="dx1-96002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">method of exhaustion</span>. The idea is that the
area outside the polygon (but inside the circle) is gradually reduced&#8212;&#8220;exhausted&#8221;&#8212;until
there&#8217;s none left and we have an exact value. But here&#8217;s where things get confusing. Even a
polygon of a hundred sides (or a million, or a billion sides) would still leave a little bit out
in the cold. What we really need is to calculate what the area would be if we had as many
sides as possible. But for that, we would need a number larger than all other possible
numbers. An infinite number, in fact.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >  The concept of <a 
 id="dx1-96003"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">infinity </span>has always exercised a powerful fascination on the
imagination, particularly of science fiction writers (&#8220;To Infinity and Beyond!&#8221;)
Literally, it means &#8220;without bound&#8221; or &#8220;endless.&#8221; The concept itself is not hard to
imagine. What is hard to imagine, is dropping something &#8220;without bound&#8221; into a
mathematical equation and treating as if it were just another number (like the number
&#8220;2&#8221;).

<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >And that&#8217;s because doing so seems to lead one into absurdities. A simple, non-numeric
example is the &#8220;light bulb paradox.&#8221; Some person has a light bulb and a switch, and is
amusing themselves by flipping the switch on and off. If the person and the bulb
are both immortal, what will the state be &#8220;at infinity?&#8221; Will the light be on or
off?
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  A simple proof shows that the light will be off. After all, the light started out off (when
the circuit was built), and every time the light is turned on, it is immediately turned off.
Therefore, every time the light is turned on, it is turned off and it never stays on. So in the
final state, it must be off.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >  However, an equally simple proof shows that the light will be on. After all, every time
the light is turned off, it is immediately turned back on, and it therefore never stays
off&#x2026;.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  Nature, like mathematics, abhors a contradiction. The light cannot be both on and off.
Therefore, there must be something wrong with one of the arguments. As it happens, there
is the same thing wrong with both arguments: the idea that there is a &#8220;final state&#8221; (at
&#8220;infinity&#8221;) and we can just look at the final state to see what it is. The simple fact is that the
&#8220;final state,&#8221; if we can call it that, is of a switch being perpetually flipped without
rest.

by 3, you get a repeating decimal 0.3333&#x2026;. Using standard place values, this stands for the
sum <br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >  3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + 3/10000 &#x2026;(and so on endlessly) <br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >  Since dividing 1 by 3 is equal to the value <img 
src="main164x.png" alt="1
3"  class="frac" align="middle">, this endless sum must also have the value <img 
src="main165x.png" alt="1
3"  class="frac" align="middle">
(what else would you get when you divide 1 by 3?). Similarly, three times this value,
or 0.9999&#x2026;, must have a well-defined final value of 1 itself. (What else could 3
times <img 
src="main166x.png" alt="1
3"  class="frac" align="middle"> be?) So it must be possible to convert this endless sum into something
tractable.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >  If &#8220;infinity&#8221; is not a number, then presumably we can&#8217;t speak of it in the same terms we
used in our chapter on algebra&#8212;which is to say, the operations we use on numbers are not
well defined when speaking of &#8220;infinity.&#8221; But the real problem is that this is only <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sometimes</span>
the case. So when does it make sense to talk about infinity and when doesn&#8217;t it? When can
we convert something &#8220;infinite&#8221; (like an endlessly repeating decimal) into something
sensible like a number? As we said before, these questions have captured the
imaginations (and sometimes the sanity) of some of the best mathematicians of the past
four hundred years. And many of the answers are counterintuitive, if not outright
strange.
<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >  To return to an earlier question: What does it mean to have an infinite number of
anything? For example, if we claim that there are an infinite number of positive
integers, how many is that? To understand this question, let&#8217;s go back to sets for a
moment.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >  Let&#8217;s consider two sets: the set of positive integers {1,2,3,&#x2026;} and the set of positive <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">even</span>
integers {2,4,6,&#x2026;}. We&#8217;ll call these two sets <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E </span>for short. First of all, we claim that
both of these are &#8220;infinite&#8221; sets, in the sense that if you started listing the elements
of either set, you would never be able to finish. They are &#8220;endless,&#8221; in an exact
sense. But does this mean that they have the same number of elements? Well, on
the one hand, every element of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E </span>can also be found in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>, so there are at least as
many elements in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>as in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E</span>. We can therefore deduce that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>is, at least, no smaller
than <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E</span>. But <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>also has some elements (in fact, an infinite number of elements)
that are not found in <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E</span>. If we were to take all the elements of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">E </span>out of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>, we&#8217;d
still have some left. So this suggests that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>is a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">larger </span>&#8220;infinite set&#8221; than <span

<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >  Another paradox, and one that can only be resolved by thinking about what &#8220;infinite&#8221;
really means. Again, the problem comes from trying to think about the end state of a

the two sets is real and something we can create in the here-and-now, but the idea of taking
all the elements of <span

seemingly paradoxical result that we can have two sets of the same size, with
one being a subset of the other. And the only real resolution is to accept that our
intuition may not be able to guide us properly in the ways of the infinite, and
that the traditional rules of arithmetic that we learned in grade school may not
apply.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >  May we blow your mind even further? Which is a bigger infinite set, the set of positive
integers, or the set of fractions? The counterintuitive answer is that the two sets are exactly
the same size, by roughly the same argument. We can set up a mapping between the set
of positive integers and the set of number pairs by simply ordering the pairs by
their total sum. For example, the set of positive integers begins {1,2,3,4,5,6,&#x2026;},
while the set of number pairs begins with {(0,1),&#x2026;} (the number pair that adds up
to 1). It then continues with { &#x2026;(0,2), (1,1),&#x2026;}, the pairs that add up to 2, and
then {&#x2026;(0,3), (1,2), (2,1) &#x2026;}. Every positive integer corresponds to a (unique)
pair.

<!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >  But this means that the <span

one function: namely, <span

complete must be missing something), and therefore we know that our initial assumption,
that such a list was possible, is false. Therefore, there is no mapping between integers and
real-valued functions, and, although there are infinitely many positive integers, there are
infinitely more functions. We therefore reach the unavoidable, if slightly uncomfortable
conclusion that &#8220;infinity&#8221; comes in different sizes. We can therefore speak of larger and
smaller &#8220;infinities.&#8221;
<!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >  The reaction to this work from Cantor&#8217;s fellow mathematicians was not, shall we say,
charitable. Like Gödel&#8217;s theorem decades later, Cantor&#8217;s ideas tended to overturn much
thinking about mathematics itself. But while Gödel&#8217;s theory caused a good deal of unease,
it was nonetheless conceded to be correct. Cantor&#8217;s ideas&#8212;which included, among other
things, a proof that there were as many points on the plane formed by the unit square as
there are on one of the lines that makes up the square&#8217;s sides&#8212;were greeted in
some quarters as a kind of heresy. Henri Poincaré (1854&#8211;1912) likened Cantor&#8217;s
ideas to a disease infecting mathematics; Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889&#8211;1951), who
took a dim view of set theory in general, considered it laughable nonsense. The
otherwise brilliant Leopold Kronecker (1823&#8211;1891) not only accused Cantor
of being a charlatan and &#8220;corrupter of youth,&#8221; but actively tried to supress the
publication of his work. About the only scholars to welcome Cantor&#8217;s ideas were the
theologians.
<!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >  Which is appropriate, because at heart this was a &#8220;religious&#8221; debate about
mathematics&#8212;about its purity and integrity as a system and its presumed correspondence
to the metaphysical fabric of the universe. In Kronecker&#8217;s estimation, &#8220;God made integers;
all else is the work of man&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbell:men">2</a>]</span> To speak of &#8220;transfinite numbers&#8221; was to speak of things the
angels dare not utter.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >  Cantor, sadly, went quietly mad, and most historians cannot avoid concluding that the
repeated rejections and ridicule of his work by some of the most prominent mathematicians
of the day had a hand in the progress of what was undoubtedly a quite severe case of mental
illness.
<!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >  There was one mathematician, though, who admired Cantor. In his <span

<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >But laying all of these objections aside, we are still left with the problem of having to deal
with &#8220;infinity&#8221; in ways that do not involve mind-blowing levels of paradox. For reasons
both practical and theoretical, we would like ordinary concepts of the infinite (repeating
decimals like 0.3333&#x2026;) to have unique, reasonable, sensible, and mathematically
tractable meanings (as we do with things like <img

too difficult or paradoxical to work with, we need to find a paradox-free method
of identifying concepts with which we can work using our ordinary methods

claim that the sequence <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">F </span>has a limit of zero (which, again, means that the sequence <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">F </span>gets
and stays close to zero.) We may be able to illustrate this by looking at some some
numbers that don&#8217;t have this property. For example, the sequence <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">F </span>never &#8220;gets
close&#8221; to 8&#8212;in fact, it never gets within 7, let alone 0.1, of 8. The sequence does
&#8220;gets close&#8221; to 1/2 (in fact, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span></sub> is 1/2 exactly), but it doesn&#8217;t <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">stay close</span>. It does,
however, both get and stay close to 0. Again, we can formalize this by noting that,
for any value of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03F5;</span>&#8212;the conventional Greek letter used to denote an arbitrarily
small, positive quantity&#8212;the distance <span

entire algebra (in the sense elaborated in chapter 3) using limits that can then be used to
calculate an unknown limit of a sequence from a group of known limits of known
sequences.
<!--l. 297--><p class="indent" >  There are, we should say, sequences that do not have limits. For example, there is no
number that the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &#x2026;) gets and stays close to. It starts by getting
closer and closer to 100, for example, but once it passes 100, it roars off into the sunset
without a backwards glance, getting farther and farther away. Mathematicians will say such
a sequence has no limit, that the limit &#8220;does not exist&#8221; (sometimes abbreviated
d.n.e.), or that the sequence <a 
 id="dx1-100008"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">diverges</span>. You will sometimes hear that the sequence
&#8220;goes to infinity,&#8221; but that, as we demonstrated at the beginning of this chapter, is
perhaps not the most precise way to put it. &#8220;Infinity&#8221; isn&#8217;t a number you can go
to.
<!--l. 299--><p class="indent" >  The light-bulb sequence is, crucially, another example of a sequence that diverges.
Looking at the partial sums, you see that the sequence is properly stated as (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,
&#x2026;). It gets &#8220;close to&#8221; 1, but then zips off to become &#8220;close to&#8221; 0, and then back to
1. In knock-down argument between Patrick and Steve, Patrick was essentially
claiming that the limit is 0, while Steve was claiming that it was 1. As we can
now see, the right answer is that the limit isn&#8217;t anything, because the sequence
diverges.

with practice the more darts he or she throws. But another important concept involving
limits is the idea of the limit of a function at a particular point. The idea here is that as one

closer to something else, even if these numbers aren&#8217;t structured as an ordered

from $110&#8211;115,000, then that&#8217;s what yours is probably worth, too. The closer the

<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >We are now in a position to give a mathematical explanation of one of the more important
concepts in applied mathematics: the idea of &#8220;continuity.&#8221; We studied discrete systems in
chapter 2&#8212;systems where data can be cleanly categorized into a few clear-cut categories.
In a discrete system, it&#8217;s either January or it&#8217;s February, but it&#8217;s never January-and-a-third;
the defendant is either guilty or not guilty; we speak of having having zero sisters
or one, but not two-fifths of a sister. By contrast, in a <a 
 id="dx1-102001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">continuous </span>system, one
category blends smoothly into another with no clear line of separation (red becomes
purple becomes blue, five centimeters becomes five and a half becomes six). This
concept captures our intutions that a falling rock or a moving arrow moves smoothly
through space instead of teleporting suddenly from point to point in a puff of
smoke.
<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >  We are now in a position to state this more formally, and to relate it to the concept of a
limit. In essence, we can say that a mathematical function is continuous at a particular point
if and only if it has a limit at that point and that limit is the same as the function&#8217;s value at
that point. (A function that is continuous at all points is said to be &#8220;continuous everywhere&#8221;
or simply &#8220;continuous.&#8221;)
<!--l. 328--><p class="indent" >  Yes, that was a bit dense. So let&#8217;s unpack it. If you have a function that doesn&#8217;t have a
value (as when you try to divide <img 
src="main191x.png" alt="0
0"  class="frac" align="middle"> or take <img 
src="main192x.png" alt="&#x221A; --1"  class="sqrt" >), it is not continuous, because it is not
defined. If the function doesn&#8217;t have a limit, that means that it has some sort of
sudden break in it, as January turns suddenly into February instead of undergoing
some kind of gradual transition. Finally, if the function has a value but the value
doesn&#8217;t match the limit, this again means that there&#8217;s a sudden jump, a break in the
function.
<!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >  Most of the the functions that people work with are continuous functions simply because
the world is (mostly) continuous; if you look at a succession of frames from a movie, you
see that the movement is broken up cleanly into discrete images. But at the same time, you
know that if you had a higher-speed camera, you would see that the spaces between the
images are filled up smoothly with smaller and smaller bits. If you are at a distance <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>from
the camera 1 second into the film, then you would be at a distance <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">+</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03F5; </span>from the camera at
1 second plus <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03B4;.</span>
<!--l. 332--><p class="indent" >  But again, not all functions are continuous. Changing the year on New Year&#8217;s Eve, for
example is not continuous. At 11:59, it&#8217;s (let&#8217;s say) 2008, heading into 2009. At 11:59:59,
it&#8217;s still 2008. At 11:59:59.9, it&#8217;s still 2008. As we get closer and closer to midnight, it still
stays 2008. Suddenly, it jumps from 2008 to 2009 (at 12:00:00 exactly). There is no time
prior to 12:00 where the year is &#8220;close to&#8221; 2009, and hence the year &#8220;function&#8221; does not
have a limit at 12:00.

<!--l. 365--><p class="indent" >  As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, Zeno was essentially maintaining that motion
is an illusion&#8212;something inherently impossible. He also illustrated this with the idea of an
arrow in flight. Considering such an arrow, we imagine time being divided into the smallest
possible moments. At any such moment&#8212;at that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">exact </span>such moment&#8212;the arrow cannot
possibly be moving, since motion implies time in which to move in. The arrow is
thus &#8220;instantaneously&#8221; at rest, and since time is just a collection of instants, the
arrow is always at rest. Hence motion does not exist. As Aristotle put it in the
Physics: &#8220;[I]f everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that
which is locomotion is always in a now, the flying arrow is therefore motionless&#8221;
(VI:239b5).

still walk at 2 km/hour. If I take 0.002 hours (about 7.2 seconds) to walk 0.004 km (4m,
about the width of a typical room) &#x2026;well, you get the idea. But if I take no time at all to
cover no distance at all, how fast am I moving? After all, a snail, or a high-speed race car,
could equally be said to take no time at all to cover no distance whatsoever. In each case,
we divide 0 by 0 to get &#x2026;an undefined mathematical entity. This is the &#8220;hole&#8221; in the line in

refuting it mathematically, since doing so requires the kind of mathematics we&#8217;ve

We can see that in the first second, the object moves from 0m to 5m&#8212;that is, a distance of
5m&#8212;in 1 second. We would therefore say that it is moving at 5m/sec during the first
second. In the second second (ahem), it moves from 5m to 20m, a distance of 15m, and
thus is moving at 15m/sec. (You can see these visually in the diagram: the speed of the
object is simply the <a

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">slope </span>of the straight lines, where slope is defined as &#8220;rise over
run&#8221;&#8212;the change in height divided by the change in length.) Note, however, that is is an
average speed over the entire second.
<!--l. 404--><p class="indent" >  These second-long averages are too coarse to give us much accuracy, however. At the
exact end of the first second, the object is part of both the first second and the second
second, and it&#8217;s speed can&#8217;t be both 5 and 15 at the same time. So how fast is the object
falling <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">at that exact instant?</span>
<!--l. 406--><p class="indent" >  We could try to get a better idea of its speed by using smaller intervals and getting a
more accurate &#8220;average.&#8221; But we can go considerably further by calculating the average
speed over a short period of time&#8212;and taking <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the limit of that average, </span>as the period
becomes infinitely short. Just as we say that the polygons approximate the circle, and that
the limit of the polygons <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">is </span>the circle, so we can say that the limit of the averages in this
case gives us the &#8220;instantaneous speed.&#8221;
<!--l. 408--><p class="indent" >  Visually, we note that the falling object creates a curve when time is plotted against the
distance fallen. This curve is, of course, a <a 
 id="dx1-104005"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">parabola</span>, and we can further note that each
interval creates a straight line that intersects the parabola at two points (the ends of the
interval). The slope of this line we have interpreted as the change in distance
divided by the change in time: i.e, the speed. As the interval becomes shorter and
shorter, the endpoints become become closer and closer, until &#8220;eventually&#8221; (in the
limit) they are the same point, and the line touches (and is parallel) to the curve at
exactly one point. Such a line is called <a

the speed at that particular instant. (See figure&#x00A0;<a

straightforward answers, and yet, as we hope we&#8217;ve demonstrated, the problem is fraught
with difficult questions that relate ultimately to the notion of &#8220;the infinite.&#8221; Limits make
such questions tractable by giving us a mathematically well-behaved construct that we
can use to perform calculations as easily as we might perform basic arithmetic
operations.

indeed, finding that line is a critical matter in a truly vast set of mathemtical problems

duration is <span

src="main196x.png" alt="f(x+h)-h-f(x)"  class="frac" align="middle">, as the formula requires. If
we need to know the instantaneous speed, we want <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">h </span>to be as small as possible
(&#8220;infinitely small&#8221; or &#8220;infinitesimal&#8221;) and therefore take the limit as <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">h </span>goes to zero.
If <span

0"  class="frac" align="middle">, but by
taking the limit we avoid division by zero. This, ultimately, is the formal answer to
Zeno.

 id="x1-1060005.2.8"></a>Calculating Derivatives</h4>
<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >It is possible to calculate the derivative of most formulas using only the limit definition
given above. In practice, there are some rules of thumb that can be used to calculate
derivatives more quickly. Here are a few:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">if <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>is a constant value, like 3, then <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032; </span>is always 0. So if a foot is always 12
      inches, then we can say that the change in the length of a foot, over any period
      of time, is zero. To put it more plainly, if something doesn&#8217;t change (i.e. is
      constant), then the rate of change is 0.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">if  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>is  the  product  of  a  constant  value  and  another  function,  then  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032; </span>is  just
      that  constant  times  the  derivative  of  the  other  functions.  For  example,  if
      <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) = 12</span><span

      growing at 1 foot per month, they are growing at 12 inches per month as well.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">if <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>is a straight line, then the rate of change is (to the everlasting relief of
      calculus students everywhere) the slope of the line. In this case, the rate of
      change is a constant and the &#8220;instantaneous&#8221; rate of change is just the rate of
      change. Mathematically, if <span

And at zero seconds, the object has not yet fallen at all, and so is not moving (0

derivative of position with respect to time is the speed&#8212;how fast position changes.
The derivative of the derivative (more often called the <a

position is the rate of change of the speed, which we know as the acceleration. The

this concept as the &#8220;jerk&#8221; (a concept that doesn&#8217;t show up in our example, since
the &#8220;jerk&#8221; of a freely falling object is zero&#8212;the acceleration due to gravity is a

can be understood as the <a 
 id="dx1-106026"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">first derivative, </span>though it is rarely spoken of as such.
Normally, &#8220;derivative&#8221; just means &#8220;first derivative.&#8221; There&#8217;s no reason in theory that
we couldn&#8217;t calculate derivatives beyond the third, though it is not commonly
necessary.
<!--l. 502--><p class="indent" >  As should be clear by now, derivatives can be used to calculate any rate of
change. Economists, for instance, will often talk about the &#8220;marginal cost&#8221; of
production, which is essentially the amount that costs would increase if you made
one more widget. This is really just the derivative of the costs, which is another
way of saying &#8220;the rate of change of costs,&#8221; which is another way of saying the
tangent line you get when you graph the number of units against the total costs of
production.

metal in the can isn&#8217;t the only cost consideration. We could set up a slightly different
equation, balancing the total cost of metal in the can with the cost involved in welding it
together, which would be proportional to the perimeter, not the area, of the shapes
involved.

<!--l. 631--><p class="noindent" >Historically, calculus has been divided into two major branches. Differential calculus
concerns itself with the calculation of derivatives (which were historically called
&#8220;differentials&#8221;) and the calculation of the slopes of tangent lines. Integral calculus (which
was at one point thought to be part of the mostly unrelated problem of areas) concerns itself
with the calculation of integrals. For centuries (more or less from the Greeks to Isaac
Newton and Gottfried Liebniz), these two problems were approached in isolation from one
other.
<!--l. 633--><p class="indent" >  It was Newton&#8217;s teacher (Isaac Barrow, 1630&#8211;1677) who showed that these two
problems are in fact the same problem. Specifically, differentiation and integration are
inverses of each other, in the same way that multiplication and division, or addition and
subtraction, are inverses of each other. This insight was formalized by Newton and Liebniz
into one of the crowning intellectual achievements of the modern era: the <a

<!--l. 635--><p class="indent" >  Despite the extraordinary amount of lateral thinking necessary for noticing
this, the result can be expressed very simply. If <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>is a function, and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">g </span>is the
integral of <span

function, and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">f </span>is the derivative of <span

<!--l. 637--><p class="indent" >  What this means in practice is that any method of calculating derivatives can
be used &#8220;in reverse&#8221; to calculate integrals. For example, the little shortcuts we
presented in section&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-1060005.2.8">5.2.8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:calcderivative --></a>, like the fact that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the
derivatives, can be reversed to capture the integral of a sum as the sum of two integrals
(or vice versa, if necessary). We can intuitively describe the speed as the rate of
change of position, or we can (alternatively) describe a position as the sum of all
the previous speed changes applied over time. The Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus validates both of those views and captures, formally, the relationship
between the two, essentially creating &#8220;calculus&#8221; as a single, unified subfield of
mathematics.

<!--l. 645--><p class="noindent" >Calculus is key to almost any analysis that involves the words &#8220;minimum,&#8221; &#8220;maximum,&#8221; or
even &#8220;best fit.&#8221; You&#8217;ve already seen how a cost-conscious engineer can apply calculus to the
problem of making a tin can as cheaply as possible. In this section, we&#8217;ll talk about a more
abstract application, a very powerful visualization and analysis technique, called
<a 
 id="dx1-112001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">multidimensional scaling </span>(or MDS).
<!--l. 647--><p class="indent" >  At its heart, multidimensional scaling is a method of creating a &#8220;map&#8221; based on
measured or perceived distances, such that things that are similar are close together and
things that are distinct are far apart. This provides and easy way to visualize the variation
among items and how items cluster, without necessarily having a pre-defined visualization
space.
<!--l. 649--><p class="indent" >  The mathematical basis is fairly straightforward. First, the user is assumed to have, for
every pair of objects, a measure of the the &#8220;distance&#8221; between them. In some cases, this
could be an actual distance, or it could be a measure of similarity based on judgement&#8212;for
example, the number of people in a focus group study who put two objects in the same pile.
If you have <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>objects, this will of course give you an <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>by <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>matrix as we saw in an earlier
chapter.
<!--l. 651--><p class="indent" >  We know from geometry that any three points can be put into an exact relationship in a
plane that preserves distances perfectly. Just as two points define a line, three points define
a plane, and in general, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>points define an <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">-</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">1 </span>dimensional space in which these
distances can be preserved. Needless to say, humans have a bit of trouble visualizing
seven-dimensional space. What we want to do is find a two-dimensional space that
preserves distances as best we can, so that we can see the relationships between and among
the various points.
<!--l. 653--><p class="indent" >  And the key to doing this involves calculus. MDS creates a configuration of points in a
two-dimensional space and assigns each object a single point in this space. As points in this
new space, they are separated by a (genuine) distance on the page. The trick is to minimize
the &#8220;stress:&#8221; the overall difference between the genuine distance on the page and the
similarity-based distance given by the user. If points <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">X </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">Y </span>are far apart on the page
but close in the matrix (or vice versa), we have a problem. More formally, if we
define <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x03B4;</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">ij</span></sub> as the distance listed in the matrix between objects <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">i </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">j</span>, and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">d</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">ij</span></sub> as
the ordinary distance between the points that represent <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">i </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">j</span>, then we want to
minimize the total across all pairs of <span

makes this a calculus problem. What we&#8217;re after is a point where the derivative is
zero.
<!--l. 655--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a rather a difficult calculus problem, since it is often not possible to
solve for this point directly. But the same insights that let us see how calculus works let us
see how we can use computers to solve this problem via iterative approximation (which is
just a fancy way of saying &#8220;let&#8217;s take a wild guess and then improve it over and over
again&#8221;). If you can figure out, for example, which point has the highest stress associated
with it and move it slightly in the proper direction, that change in direction will improve the
overall stress. We can then do this until that point is no longer the one with the highest
stress, and do the same thing with whatever point has the (next) highest stress.
Eventually, we&#8217;ll get to a point where no small changes to anything make any
difference to the overall stress, which is a pretty good example of what &#8220;where the
derivative is zero&#8221; means. Of course, this is laborious and time-consuming&#8212;not to
say boring&#8212;work to do by hand, but computers are great at doing this kind of
thing. In fact, computers can use even more complicated, but faster ways to do
MDS.

with GIS systems to locate things that we&#8217;re not sure about, such as lost historical sites. If
we could construct a matrix of travel times (based on contemporary reports) that described
how long it took to get from a known place (such as the Tower of London) to a place we
have since lost track of (Castle Anthrax?), we could construct a map like the one above and

<!--l. 693--><p class="noindent" >At the beginning of this chapter, we noted that we were going to try to get at the concepts
of calculus &#8220;through the back door.&#8221; What we meant by that will perhaps be clearer when
we note that the original proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus did not avail itself
of the idea of limits, and in fact, could not have done so. Newton and Leibniz did their work
in the seventeenth century&#8212;long before the theory of limits was discovered by
Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789&#8211;1857) in 1821. Much of modern instruction in calculus
directly reverses this pattern. In a typical university curriculum today, students are
usually given a course in &#8220;pre-calculus&#8221; that discusses the idea of limits (and
associated concepts such as continuity), and then this course continues with calculus
proper (in which the ideas of differential calculus and the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus are set forth). Integral calculus, and the calculations of volumes of
geometric forms, is usually deferred until a second or sometimes even a third
course.
<!--l. 695--><p class="indent" >  Historically, though, the question of area was the first to be studied (by the ancient
Greeks, as we mentioned). After that, the question of tangent lines and derivatives was
taken up by Archimedes, and then extended (much further) by Indian and Arabic
mathematicians, who also created the idea of a derivative, in the first millennium. The
Fundamental Theorem was proven by Newton and Liebniz, as we mentioned, but it would
be another fifty years before the formal foundations were finally established by Cauchy.
This may at least partially explain the frequent lament (made by teachers as well as
students) that calculus books often read like they were written backwards. In some sense,
they really were.
<!--l. 697--><p class="indent" >  Early in this chapter, we described calculus as &#8220;the mathematics of change.&#8221; We still
think that&#8217;s an apt description, and one that renders its applications in science and
engineering as obvious as they are manifold. That the humanities are themselves concerned
with change suggests, perhaps, a point of intersection with those fields that attempt to join
humanistic inquiry with computational methods, and indeed, advanced methods such
as data mining, machine learning, and statistical natural language processing
frequently require methods drawn from calculus. But we cannot resist noting the
ways in which calculus itself is a fit object of humanistic concern&#8212;as much an
achievement of the modern world as its grandest works of art. Some say, despite
the occasional strong candidate, that the great explanation of calculus&#8212;one as
approachable as it is astounding&#8212;has yet to be written. We eagerly await another book
(written, we suspect, either by a humanist-turned-mathematician or its inverse)
that places calculus properly within the cultural context of modernity. In fact,
we suspect that the former won&#8217;t succeed until the latter performs its necessary
work.



  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">6</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;<a 
 id="x1-1140006"></a>Differential Equations</h2>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >In the previous chapter, we discussed the mathematics of change as expressed in the
calculus, and called it one of the most brilliant ideas in mathematical history. And this is
good news, because the analysis of change&#8212;including both the causes and the effects of
change&#8212;is one of the key intellectual components of scientific inquiry as such.
Humanisitic inquiry, too, is mostly about trying to deal with multiple forms of change and
sorting out what&#8217;s going on in an extremely complicated system called &#8220;human
culture.&#8221;
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  But most real-world systems, whether cultural or &#8220;natural,&#8221; possess a level of complexity
that is truly formidable. For the scientist, understanding complex systems is less about
finding the trajectory of some object through space, and more about understanding the
underlying factors that govern highly dynamical systems like climates, animal ecologies,
and quantum phenomena, in which thousands (or millions) of elusive factors and
underlying variables are at play. For the humanist, nearly every problem takes
this essential form. What factors conspired to end monarchical government (or
human slavery, or epic poetry, or photo-realistic painting) in so much of the modern
world? What factors led to the rise of the English novel? What factors led to the
Reformation?
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  The study of such systems (and the differential equations that stand at their core) is a
well-established part of scientific inquiry, but similar investigation of &#8220;humane
systems&#8221; is extremely rare. Indeed, the idea that the kind of change we see in
cultural systems can be modeled in a mathematically tractable manner surprises
many people. Economics (a field which we still consider a humanities discipline)
represents one way, but even the economist acknowledges that the humanistic
problems outlined above weren&#8217;t merely a matter of money circulating through a
society. In an age of &#8220;big data&#8221;&#8212;including big cultural data&#8212;applying the theory of
dynamical systems (via differential equations) to data drawn from cultural instead
of physical artifacts might well revolutionize our understanding of the human
condition.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  If we sound a bit vague on this point, it is perhaps because this kind of
investigation&#8212;quantitative analysis of cultural phenomena&#8212;is a truly new field. And
unfortunately, we must, at the risk of quoting Barbie, point out that the math is hard. We&#8217;ll
not lie to you; this is a challenging chapter. It&#8217;s the sort of material that few people outside
of advanced mathematics and the hard sciences ever try to come to grips with. And of all
the chapters in this book, this one has the least obvious relation to the kinds of mathematics
that humanists are inclined to want to work with right now. We present this chapter in the
hope that it will be the kind of mathematics that humanists will want to work with in the
future.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  From a strictly mathematical point of view, our task is to discover a way to identify
factors that underly changes in complex systems&#8212;factors that will often include the current
state of the system itself.

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >To get a sense of why this is hard, set a cup of coffee and a cold beer out on the counter and
watch how the temperatures change. The beer will get warm while the coffee cools. But to
model this mathematically is surprisingly tricky, because while it true that hot things will
cool, and hotter things will cool more rapidly, in mathematical terms, this means that the
change-in-temperature (which, you&#8217;ll recall from chapter&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-940005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter:calculus --></a>, is the derivative of
temperature) <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">is related to the temperature itself. </span>This makes determining the temperature at
any given time and how it changes a quite challenging task. At the same time, it illuminates
many other important processes in the physical world, and perhaps the cultural world as
well.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  The hotter the coffee, the faster it cools. This situation creates what mathematicians call
as a <a 
 id="dx1-115001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">differential equation</span>: an equation that describes a relationship between an unknown
function and one or more of its derivatives. In this case, the physical setup can be
described by Newton&#8217;s Law of Cooling: the rate of change in the temperature of
an object is directly proportional to the difference in temperature between the
object and its surroundings. We can formalize this by the equation we are about to
present. In this equation, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>represents the (current) temperature of the coffee,
while <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032; </span>or <img 
src="main233x.png" alt="dx
dt"  class="frac" align="middle"> represents the instantaneous rate of temperature change. We also
need to know the temperature of the room (which we will call <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">r</span></sub> and assume
remains constant), and we will use the letter <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">k </span>to represent a currently unknown
constant.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  Before we get to <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">k</span>, though, let&#8217;s make sure we understand what &#8220;directly proportional&#8221;
means. Basically, it means that two functions are &#8220;in proportion&#8221; no matter what scaling
factor you use. If you are twice as tall as your favorite nephew when measured in inches,
you will also be twice as tall when measured in centimeters, meters, or miles, because the
difference is just a constant multiplier. If you buy twice as much gasoline, you
will pay twice as much, because the cost per gallon is a constant that applies
proportionately to every gallon equally. In mathematical terms, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y </span>are directly
proportional if and only if there is some <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">k </span>(the price per gallon) that relates <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span>
as:
  <table

<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Notice, though, that it doesn&#8217;t really matter what <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">k </span>is; if the price of gasoline goes up, it will
have a different price per gallon, but it will still have a unique and proportional price
per gallon. By contrast, temperature in Fahrenheit is not directly proportional to
temperature in Celsius, since you can&#8217;t apply a constant multiplier to get from 0 to 32
degrees.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  And what is <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">? </span>We&#8217;ve already said that it is &#8220;the temperature of the coffee.&#8221; But since the
coffee is cooling, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>can&#8217;t be a simple number. For <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>to change, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x </span>must be a function,
and specifically a function of time. We could say that the temperature &#8220;now&#8221; is
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(0)</span>, while the temperature one hour from now will be <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">x</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(1)</span>. Our task, then, is to

<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >As we have seen with calculus, one of the primary mental difficulties with differential
equations is simply the number of types of problems out there. Calculus students are
typically called upon to memorize many different formulas and methods: one for
polynomial functions, one for trigonometric functions, one for exponential functions, one
for composite functions, and in more rarefied fields of mathematical endeavor, some
considerably more obscure varieties. The same thing is regrettably true for different types
of differential equations. Depending upon the form of a differential equation,
people need to use different methods to solve them, and some forms don&#8217;t have
nice clean solutions at all, irrespective of the method one uses. So in order to
understand differential equations, we first need to engage in a bit of taxonomy and
terminology.

<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >In light of these different categories (many of which seem to require completely different
solution methods), the single most important question to ask is whether or not all the
different (applicable) methods are likely to get the same answer. Mathematicians usually
phrase these in terms of <a

 id="dx1-119002"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">uniqueness </span>(a distinction by no means limited to
differential equations). In essence, we&#8217;re dealing with two closely-related questions: does a
solution exist, and is that solution unique?
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >  Obviously, if no solution exists at all to a problem, it is pointless to try to look for one;
confirming that a solution exists before embarking on a lengthy search is therefore only
common sense. But more significantly, if there are many possible solutions, two different
methods might find two different solutions&#8212;and miss each other&#8217;s solutions, in a sort of
mathematical &#8220;blind men and the elephant&#8221; situation. On the other hand, if the solution is
unique, then any two methods that find <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">any </span>solution will automatically both find <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the</span>
solution (i.e., the same one). Existence and uniqueness proofs are thus part of the
bread-and-butter of working mathematicians, but particularly so with differential
equations.

been proven for us, and unless you are really into the deep mysteries of mathematical

there is still a catch. To understand exactly what &#8220;existence&#8221; and &#8220;uniqueness&#8221; mean in this

this is likewise true for <span

class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">-</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">14 </span>all satisfy our differential equation as well. This means
that our solution defines not a single function, but a family of functions. We can
describe this family by saying that &#8220;<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) = </span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C </span>for any constant value <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C</span>.&#8221; This sort of
&#8220;family-resemblance&#8221; is common in differential equations as well. Because many different
functions will have the same derivatives (differentiation is a many-to-one function),
many different, but related, functions will usually solve a given equation. We can,
however, usually show that these functions are all related mathematically and
give a way of choosing a particular function from the family. In this case, we can
say that the function <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y </span>is &#8220;unique up to a constant,&#8221; meaning that if we pick a
specific value for <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C </span>(or have it picked for us by our data), our value for <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y </span>is truly
unique.
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >  The usual way we find this sort of specific value is by using a <a 
 id="dx1-120001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">boundary condition</span>. For
example, if we know the temperature <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) = </span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">C </span>(our forever-unchanging cup of coffee), then
we can just look at what the temperature is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">now </span>to know what the temperature will be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">then</span>.
Usually, the problem statement will specify one or more points (typically at the
beginning of the system, hence the &#8220;boundary&#8221;) exactly and the equations can be
used to predict how things change away from the boundary. If the ever-warm cup
of coffee is 30C right now, and the temperature never changes, then it will also
be 30C tomorrow. Equation&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-128009r46">6.46<!--tex4ht:ref: eqn:coffee --></a> gives a more realistic example where the cup
actually cools, and we have to use the boundary conditions to determine how
much.

write down the family of solutions for any first-order linear differential equation,
and apply the starting conditions to determine the specific values of the relevant

much you get depends on how much you already have, a first-order differential equation
can be used to model it.

<!--l. 402--><p class="indent" >  One interesting application of this law and this type of analysis is in medical forensics
(where we&#8217;re trying to estimate the time of death). A normal human body has a temperature
of about 37C (98.6F). After death, it will typically cool (over a matter of a few
hours) to the ambient temperature, 20C or so indoors, and almost anything outside.
Suppose that a coroner is called to the scene and measures the temperature of a
dead body at 30C at midnight, and then re-measures the temperature at 25C two
hours later (assuming the ambient temperature is 20C throughout.) At this point,
one can use the two values <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(0) = 30 </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span

determine the value of <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">k</span>, how fast this specific body loses heat in this specific
circumstance. But once he&#8217;s done that, he can now use this equation to predict at what
time the body temperature was 37C (the time will naturally be negative, and in
this case will be around -1.5). This means, of course, that the body was alive an
hour-and-a-half before midnight, so we conclude that the time of death was at about
10:30pm.

out is a little trickier, since it depends on the amount already in the tank. If we

the rate at which it leaves the tank is the flow rate times the concentration in the

small coils of wire that respond to changes in current by generating a magnetic
field. In particular, the current flowing through a capacitor is the derivative of
the voltage, and the voltage across an inductor is the derivative of the current.
This means, among other things, that both capacitors and inductors can store
energy. But what happens when you get a circuit that contains both resistors and
capacitors/inductors?

there are two spots that can store energy. Energy can go from the battery into
either the capacitor or the inductor, but it can also wash back and forth between
the capacitor and the inductor in a kind of wave. A full discussion of this point
is probably beyond the scope of this book (Patrick took a two semester course

<!--l. 500--><p class="noindent" >Of course, most of the readers of this book are expected to be humanities scholars, not
electrical engineers&#8212;it&#8217;s understandable if your interest in &#8220;capacitors&#8221; is limited. But the
same techniques that describe how resistors respond to current can also describe how foxes
respond to rabbits and vice versa. Or, for that matter, how humans respond to advertising.
Given a reasonable set of assumptions, is it possible to model how a company&#8217;s market
share varies over time with their advertising budget? The most reasonable form for such a
model is to look at market share, and to model the change in market share as a function of
other aspects.
<!--l. 502--><p class="indent" >  According to the model developed by Suresh P. Sethi, there are three important aspects
to advertising. The first is simply the response of the public, especially the unsold public, to
the advertisement, a factor that will tend to increase market size. The second is
the natural tendency of people to forget about ads (or to respond to the ads of
competitors instead), a factor that decreases market size. The third factor is essentially a
random effect, one that can go either way and covers unforeseen and unforeseeable
effects.
<!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >  The actual Sethi advertising model (simplified a bit)looks like this:

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">X</span><span

how much money or TV time you&#8217;re buying, while <span

advertising (selling hearing aids on the radio or advertising literacy classes in the

the more effective your advertising is, the more your market share increases. At the time
time, though, the greater your market share is initially, the less you will be able to increase
it &#8212; if you already have 95% of the custom, the number of additional people who <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">can </span>buy
your stuff is only 5%. (We saw a similar term to this in the sophisticated population growth
example; the underlying argument is exactly the same. Just as an ecosystem can&#8217;t have
more people than its carrying capacity, similarly you can&#8217;t have more than 100% market
share.)
<!--l. 515--><p class="indent" >  The second term, <span

to lose to competitors. The third term of course just says that &#8220;stuff happens&#8221;
and circumstances beyond your control may give you a better or worse market
share.
<!--l. 517--><p class="indent" >  We&#8217;re not going to solve this equation here. It would be boring and cumbersome. But we
wanted to show it to you. From an economic point of view, this formula is nice because it
provides a mathematically tractable way to predict the effectiveness of an advertising
campaign. In general, most companies don&#8217;t want to have a 100% market share, or more
accurately, aren&#8217;t willing to spend the huge amounts of money it would take to get that
large a market share. As you can see from the formulation above, to get your market share
above 99% (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">X &#x003E; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">0</span><span

multiplier <img

  1- X"  class="sqrt" > would be so small, requiring a huge <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">U </span>to offset it. Intuitively,
we understand that that last stubborn customer might need a huge amount of
convincing. But this formula lets people calculate roughly how huge that amount
is.
<!--l. 520--><p class="indent" >  Economics, in particular, is full of humanistic applications of differential equations. One
of the most famous is the Black-Scholes equation, a differential equation that
defines how much a stock option should be worth (and in particular, identifies
the key aspects of such an option that control its price). Scholes won the Nobel
Prize in 1997 for the development of this model, an indicator of its significance.
But differential equations underly many other aspects of economics, including
measures of risk, the search for equilibrium and stability, and changes in labor
productivity.

<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >Much of the theory of differential equations centers around the the idea of finding a specific
category of equation (like homogenous first-degree linear equations) and finding a specific
method to solve them. Earlier in the chapter, we discussed trying to find &#8220;guidelines&#8221; for
solving differential equations. It would be really nice if we could present a general
framework where you simply turn the crank and the answer pops out, no matter how big or
ugly the equations&#8212;an algorithmic method such as we use to solve long-division problems
of any size.
<!--l. 527--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t do that. In fact, no one can. No one knows of such a framework,
and it very probable that such a framework doesn&#8217;t exist. Differential equations research is,
for the reason, a rather <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ad hoc </span>collection of different categories (such as first-order linear
equations) and methods that work on specific categories for precisely this reason. But the
categories that people look at tend to be the ones that arise in the real world. In other words,
if you know enough categories and enough methods, you can solve most of the problems
that come up, especially since the ones that come up often are the ones people have tried
hardest to solve.
<!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >  But there&#8217;s an alternative approach&#8212;one that has become very popular in the age of
computing. Instead of trying to derive an exact formula for the family of solutions,
why not use a computer to generate numeric solutions to differential equations
instead? After all, the structure of a differential equation lends itself immediately
to a physical model. You have a parameter <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span>, which generates a function <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">t</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">)</span>.
At time 0, you know the value of the function <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">y</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(0)</span>, and if necessary the values
<span

class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(0)</span>, <span

class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2032;&#x2032;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(0) </span>and so forth. Using this information, you can compute the values
of the highest derivatives, which tell you how each of the values you have will
change.

actual value of the derivative to extrapolate a possible new value. For example, if
the derivative is indeed 1, then a naive linear extrapolation would suggest that
new values should be on the straight line (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), and so forth. (See

of a differential equation to within one part in a billion or so, so unless you need truly
phenomenal amounts of precision, computational methods will usually work well
enough.

the &#8220;lowest point&#8221; in such a basin. If the population is positive but less than <span

<!--l. 593--><p class="indent" >  These are not linear equations, since some of the variables are multiplied against each
other (like <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">xy</span>). It is not practical to solve them directly, but they can be solved (more
or less) using a computer. Lorenz found that this system of equations could be
solved, but that it was incredibly sensitive to the initial conditions; changing a value
from 0.506127 to 0.50600 (for convenience) would produce radically different
results. They started out looking the same, but the tiny errors introduced by this
minute change would rapidly multiply until the solution was not just inaccurate,
but of a completely different form. This tiny change&#8212;in fact, almost any tiny
change&#8212;seemed to cross into a different basin of attraction and follow a different
attractor.
<!--l. 595--><p class="indent" >  A similar problem had been identified earlier in the work of Poincaré on the three-body
problem. The two-body problem (solved by Newton and his contemporaries) is a classic
problem in mathematical astronomy; given two bodies, determine the paths that they will
follow due to the mutual influence of gravity. However, if you add a third body into
the mix, the math gets much more complicated; not only does the Sun have an
effect on Jupiter and Jupiter on the Sun, but both planets also are affected (and
affect) Saturn. The effects of Saturn are relatively minor, but profound in the
long-term. it turns out that the three-body problem also generates a system where
small changes in the initial conditions can have a huge effect on the long-term
results.
<!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >  In theory, a well-behaved differential equation is completely deterministic. If you know
the constants (exactly) and the initial conditions (exactly), you can determine (exactly)
how the system will behave for as far into the future as you like to project. In
practice, you can never know the constants exactly. You might ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s the
mass of Jupiter?&#8221; but can we know that to a millionth of a gram? A billionth of a
gram? A trillionth? In such a system, any error or uncertainty in measurement
will unavoidably be multiplied without limit in a long-term simulation of the
system.
<!--l. 600--><p class="indent" >  This, then, is why we say that the Earth&#8217;s orbit is only more-or-less stable, because it is
in a system involving other planets, and we cannot determine exactly what influences they
will have. We can with relative confidence predict that the Earth&#8217;s orbit will not change
much in the next hundred or thousand years, but we can say little about the next ten million
or ten billion. We simply don&#8217;t know Jupiter&#8217;s mass accurately enough&#8212;and will never
know it accurately enough. And so eventually Earth&#8217;s orbit is likely to change
radically under the influence of the other planets, but we can&#8217;t say why, how, or when
exactly.
<!--l. 602--><p class="indent" >  This helps to explain why long-term weather prediction is so difficult and the predictions
so inaccurate. The temperature affects the pressure affects the wind affect the rainfall.
However, a person lighting a cigarette might make a tiny change (that we didn&#8217;t know
about) in the local temperature, and that tiny change will be multiplied in the weather
system, and a month from now, the weather could be almost anything. No wonder such
systems were dubbed &#8220;chaotic.&#8221;

 id="dx1-137001"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">butterfly effect</span>. A butterfly
flaps its wings somewhere, and changes the wind patterns from what our computers say
they are. Our computers can&#8217;t track the wind accurately enough, but this slight change in
the initial conditions is enough, eventually, to have a profound change on the overall
weather.
<!--l. 606--><p class="indent" >  Of course, the idea that small things can have huge effects is not new; as a popular
proverb has it, &#8220;great oaks from small acorns grow.&#8221; We like this famous poem about

about &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; as one of those abstruse mathematical ideas that has managed to
capture the popular imagination. As with earlier instances, the emphasis is often
placed on what mathematics (or physics, or computers) cannot do. But in all of
these cases&#8212;and especially in the case of chaos theory&#8212;the insights gleaned
from advanced study of these phenomena have tended to be highly productive.
Understanding where chaos appears has led to enourmous insights into the nature of
highly complex, dynamic systems, ranging from ecologies to economies, and
it has opened doors to interdisciplinary collaborations across widely divergent
disciplines. Whenever we contemplate such matters as influence, genre, memes, and
cultural change, we wonder if humanists might add further insights to this important
area.

<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  Well, there you have it.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  In the introduction, we claimed that our purpose in writing this book was eminently
practical. We intended to write a primer on advanced mathematics for humanists, and
further maintained that having a background in the conceptual foundations of mathematical
reasoning and its sometimes hieratic notation was the key to facilitating further research on
data mining, geo-spatial analysis, computational linguistics, programming, image analysis,
and the various other technical endeavors that make up what is now called the Digital
Humanities.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  We hope we&#8217;ve achieved that goal, but perhaps it&#8217;s time to come clean and put forth
some of our loftier motives.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  University administrators are fond of the term &#8220;interdisciplinarity,&#8221; and so are we. After
all, we&#8217;ve both built scholarly careers that are fundamentally based on a desire to look over
the fence, and we&#8217;re hardly alone. For all that, we are aware that transcending one&#8217;s own
disciplinary training is, at some level, impossible. If you are (like one of us) an
English professor, you have inherited not simply a list of books read and classes
taken, but the tacit assumptions and values of an entire community. If you are (like
the other of us) a professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, you have
likewise inherited an entire worldview about what kinds of problems there are
and what kinds of problems are worth investigating. Exchanging one kind of
heritage for another is no easy a matter, and in the end, time is perhaps the least
significant barrier. The living intellectual communities in which a discipline exists are
surrounded by vast bureaucracies, rules, publishing regimes, tenure requirements, and
peer-review systems that very often exhort one to get off their land (or stay on
it).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  We are aware, of course, of many successful attempts to venture forth. The biologist who
gains facility with computation becomes a &#8220;computational biologist;&#8221; the historian who
undertakes deep study of scientific matters becomes an &#8220;historian of science;&#8221; the linguist
who ventures into biology becomes an &#8220;evolutionary linguist.&#8221; But no sooner have these
&#8220;interdisciplines&#8221; been born, than the cycle begins again. Departments and programs are
created, students are taught, journals are established, and before long these once anxious
pairings become just another walled garden. When that happens, those who pioneered the
venture feel a sense of well-earned pride, but may also feel as if the giddy days of first
contact have subsided&#8212;and with them, a sense of intellectual excitement and
vitality.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  One of the most difficult matters we&#8217;ve encountered in writing this book is getting the
&#8220;tone&#8221; right. It is one thing for a curious intellectual to venture tentatively into another
discipline; it is another thing entirely to suggest&#8212;as we implicitly do&#8212;that what
one discipline knows, another should. In the end, we&#8217;ve spoken the only way we
know how, with what we hope is the right mixture of humor and seriousness,
boldness and humility. But our real goal in doing this was perhaps to evoke the
ancient meaning of the word &#8220;discipline,&#8221; which has its roots in a distinction
between the property of the scholar or &#8220;doctor&#8221; <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">(doctrina) </span>and his or her practice
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">(disciplina). </span>Our intention was not so much to create new kinds of scholars and
scholarly categories, but to suggest new ways of conducting one&#8217;s intellectual
life.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  It would have been possible to write a book in which we move through each
mathematical subject and apply it to some humanities problem: topology for the GIS
practitioner, predicate logic for the student of language, graph theory for the social network
analyst. By now, it should be clear that we did not write that book&#8212;not because such a
book couldn&#8217;t be written, but because we felt that to do so would be to break faith with
what we regard as the truly momentous <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">disciplina </span>of the &#8220;interdisciple.&#8221; The professor of
French literature who ventures, against all outside pressure, into differential equations is
taking a bold, uncertain leap. We have no idea what will come of that. She has no idea
what will come of that. We are certain that something truly great will come of
that.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >In several places in this book we invoke some elementary rule of mathematical
manipulation without much comment&#8212;often by saying that &#8220;high school algebra
shows&#8221; that something or other is true. We&#8217;re referring, of course, to something like
the basic &#8220;grammar&#8221; of mathematics, which most of us acquire prior to entering
college.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  We are aware, of course, that that moment of preparation may be a quite distant memory
for many of our readers, and so we offer this appendix as a brief and brisk re-introduction
to that basic set of mathematical rules and techniques. To be very explicit: this summary
covers math below university level (what education professionals generally call &#8220;secondary
school&#8221;). In the USA or Australia, this would be high school, while in England this would
be GCSE-level. Since, in many cases, this could be material that you were first exposed
to at the tender age of twelve or so, you&#8217;ve likely had lots and lots of time to
forget some of the details. Have no fear; it will all come back to you in short
order.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Algebra, in the context of higher mathematics, is a much broader and grander subject,
which we discuss in Chapter 2. Nearly every chapter in this book, however, assumes
familiarity of what we set forth here.

expressions like <span

that we can replace any (complicated) expression by a simpler expression that
has the same value, and there are a number of rules that have to be thoroughly
absorbed in order to undertake the usually quite necessary process of making things
simpler.
